                " God - would have finished after the",
                " few attempts they made in that connection.",
                " Some people might even entertain a rather",
                " simplistic image of their mission. It might",
                " be thought that a Prophet would have",
                " suddenly risen and proclaimed to his people",
                " that he had been designated by God",
                " as a Prophet. This would have been",
                " followed by the raising of objections to",
                " that claim. Subsequently, the Prophet concerned would",

                " removed their misgivings. The people would have",
                " stuck to their position, would have rejected",

                " he had proved his mettle as a",
                " good general during the expedition to Ethiopia.",
                " Furthermore, during the course of his eight",
