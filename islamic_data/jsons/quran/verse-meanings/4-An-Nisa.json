                " of Christ are urged to acknowledge God",

                " in the prophethood of all the Prophets,",
                " and that Jesus was one of them.",
                " This was the teaching of Christ and",

                " to recognize.",

                " abandon the trinitarian doctrine, regardless of the",
                " form in which it was found. The",
                " fact is that the Christians subscribe simultaneously",
                " to the unity and the trinity of",
                " God. The statements of Jesus on this",
                " question in the Gospels, however, are so",
                " categorical that no Christian can easily justify",
                " anything but the clear, straightforward doctrine that",
                " God is One and that there is",
                " no god but He. The Christians, therefore,",
                " find it impossible to deny that monotheism",
                " is the very core of true religion.",
                " But the original confusion that in Jesus",
                " the Word of God became flesh, that",
                " the Spirit of God was incarnate in",
                " him, led them to believe in the",
                " godhead of Jesus and of the Holy",
                " Ghost along with that of God. This",
                " gratuitous commitment gave rise to an insoluble",
                " riddle: how to combine monotheism with the",
                " notion of trinity. For over eighteen centuries",
                " Christian theologians have grappled with this self-created",
                " riddle. The concept of the trinity is",
                " capable of such a myriad of interpretations",
                " that literally dozens of sects have arisen",
                " as a result of its ambiguity. And",
                " it has been largely responsible for the",
                " various Christian churches indulging in mutual excommunication.",
                " Moreover, it is logically impossible to maintain",
                " belief in trinity without impairing belief in",
                " One God. This problem has arisen because",
                " of the extravagance in which the Christians",
                " have indulged. The easiest course to get",
                " out of the morass is to give",
                " up the innovated belief in the godhead",
                " of Jesus and of the Holy Ghost,",
                " acknowledge God as the Only God, and",
                " accept Jesus as His Messenger rather than",
                " as God's partner in godhead.",
                "*216). This",
                " is the refutation of the fourth extravagance",
                " in which the Christians have indulged. Even",
                " if the reports embodied in the New",
                " Testament are considered authentic, the most that",
                " can be inferred from them (particularly those",
                " embodied in the first three Gospels) is",
                " that Jesus likened the relationship between God",
                " and His servants to that between a",
                " father and his children, and that he",
                " used to employ the term 'father' as",
                " a metaphor for God. But in this",
                " respect Jesus was not unique. From very",
                " ancient times the Israelites had employed the",
                " term 'father' for God. The Old Testament",
                " is full of examples of this usage.",
                " Jesus obviously employed this expression in conformity",
                " with the literary usage of his people.",
                " Moreover, he characterized God not merely as",
                " his own father but as the father",
                " of all men. Nevertheless, the Christians exceeded",
                " all reasonable limits when they declared Jesus",
                " to be the only begotten son of",
                " God. Their strange doctrine on this question",
                " is that since Jesus is an incarnation,",
                " an embodiment of the Word and Spirit",
                " of God, he is therefore the only",
                " son of God, who was sent to",
                " the earth in order to expiate the",
                " sins of humanity through his crucifixion. The",
                " Christians hold this to be their basic",
                " doctrine even though they cannot produce one",
                " shred of evidence from the statements of",
                " Jesus himself. This doctrine was a later",
                " product of their fancies, an outcome of",
                " the extravagance in which they indulged as",
                " a result of their impression of the",
                " awe-inspiring personality of their Prophet.",
                "God does",
                " not repudiate here the doctrine of expiation,",
                " for this is not an independent doctrine",
                " but a corollary of recognizing Jesus as",
                " the son of God, and is a",
                " mystical and philosophical answer to the query",
                " as to why the only begotten son",
                " of God died an accursed death on",
                " the cross. The doctrine of expiation automatically",
                " falls apart by repudiating the dogma that",
                " Jesus was the son of God and",

                " crucified.",

                " true relationship between God and His creatures",
                " is one between the Lord and His",
                " slave. This repudiates the idea that the",
