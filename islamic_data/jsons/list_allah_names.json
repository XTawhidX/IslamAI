As a way of developing His relationship with us, He tells us more about Him. The names most frequently used in the Qur'an are the names of Rahmah (i.e., His mercy). We begin every surah with the exception of Surah Taubah with the recitation of the Basmala (i.e., the bismillah), in which we proclaim His mercy. The Qur'an is a gift from Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670, a sign of His mercy.

Whichever [name] you call \u2013 to Him belong the best names.\u201d And do not recite [too] loudly in your prayer or [too] quietly but seek between that an [intermediate] way.\" \u2014 (Qur'an 17:110)\nIn the Qur'an \"My mercy encompasses all things\" (Qur'an 7:156) and Shaykh Tosun Bayrak writes of this name \"He is the one who wills mercy and good for all creation, at all times, without any distinction between the good and the bad, the faithful and the rebel, the beloved and the hated.\" It is clear from this verse there is no discrimination as to whose worthy of His mercy and compassion.\nThe Names of Mercy:There are eight names that refer to His mercy and kindness: Ar-Rahman, Ar-Raheem, Ar-Ra'uf, Al-Barr, Al-Wahhab, Al-Ghaffar, Al-Afuww, and At-Tawwab. Each name, although related under the umbrella of mercy, is unique. We'll explore each in detail and see the various ways in which Allah's mercy manifests. As for the name Ar-Rahman it is reserved for Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 alone. It's a quality that can't be ascribed to anybody else. A person can be referred to as Raheem, meaning being merciful. But Ar-Rahman is understood to be all-encompassing mercy, so far-reaching that it touches everything and everyone. A kind of mercy that knows no bounds. As a name, it is understood this kind of mercy is reserved only for Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670. A person named Rahman must therefore have the prefix Abdur, meaning servant of the merciful.\n\n\nFrom the hadith, it comments on Allah's Rahmat (mercy), \u201cVerily, Allah has one hundred portions of mercy. From one portion the creation has been given mercy by virtue of which there is mutual love between the people and ninety nine portions are reserved for the Day of Resurrection.\u201d  [1]\nAbdullah ibn Amr reported: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said, \u201cThose who are merciful will be shown mercy by the Most Merciful. Be merciful to those on the earth and the One in the heavens will have mercy upon you.\u201d [2]\nReflection:The belief in Allah's mercy is beneficial to a believer because it causes an individual to reflect on their ability to be merciful themselves. Narrated Jarir bin `Abdullah: Allah's Messenger (\ufdfa) said, \"Allah will not be merciful to those who are not merciful to mankind.\" [3] It also encourages a believer to do good, to act with virtue so that they can receive the mercy of their Lord, \"As for those who believe and do good, the Most Compassionate will certainly bless them with genuine love\" (Surah Maryam ayah 96) \n'Umar b. Khattab reported that there were brought some prisoners to Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him) amongst whom there was also a woman, who was searching (for someone) and when she found a child amongst the prisoners, she took hold of it, pressed it against her chest and provided it suck. Thereupon Allah's Messenger (\ufdfa) said: Do you think this woman would ever afford to throw her child in the Fire? We said: By Allah, so far as it lies in her power, she would never throw the child in Fire.' Thereupon Allah's Messenger (\ufdfa) said: Allah is more kind to His servants than this woman is to her child. [4]\nAllah's mercy is vast and is described by Prophet \ufdfa to be greater than a mother's love for her child. In Imam Zarruq's book, The loftiest goal in elucidating Allah's most beautiful names he recommends attaching oneself to this name through \"fellowship, hope, behaving with extreme affection because of firm trust in His affection.\" Know Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 is all-wise and all-knowing, you're forgiveness towards others, and their imperfections will be rewarded on the day of judgment. Lead with hope and compassion and seek to assist those who are misguided as they are in need. And on a concluding note for this name, begin every task by calling upon Ar-Rahman through the phrase, \"Bismillah Hir-Rahman Nir-Rahim,\" which means \"In the name of God, The Most Gracious, The Most Merciful.\" All things are only made possible with Allah's blessing. We, too, require His mercy and grace in all matters.\nHadith References:\n[1] Sahih Muslim 2753\n[2] Sunan al-Tirmidhi 1924\n[3] Sahih al-Bukhari 7376\n[4] Sahih al-Bukhari 5999 & Sahih Muslim 2754\n\n\n",

Ibn Arabi in unveiling the secret of the most beautiful names mentions, \"God indicated that this Mercy was limited and restrained, after having manifested unconditional, absolute, and universal general mercy. Also, its relation to the servant depends on his limitations.\" But here lies some disagreement among scholars.

Indeed, Allah forgives all sins. Indeed, it is He who is the Forgiving, the Merciful.'\" \u2014 (Qur'an 39:53)\nHadith which illustrates Allah's mercy: Allah's mercy is vast, we can not begin to fathom the many ways in which He's shown us mercy. As we mentioned in the name Ar-Rahman, The Prophet \ufdfa said to us, \"Do you think this woman could throw her child in the fire?\" We said, \"No, not if she is able to stop it.\" The Prophet said, \"Allah is more merciful to His servants than a mother is to her child.\" [1]\nOn the authority of Ibn Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him), from the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa): \"Verily Allah has written down the good deeds and the evil deeds, and then explained it: \"Whosoever intended to perform a good deed, but did not do it, then Allah writes it down as a completed good deed. And if he intended to perform it and then did perform it, then Allah writes it down as from ten good deeds up to seven hundred times, up to many times multiplied. And if he intended to perform an evil deed, but did not do it, then Allah writes it down as a complete good deed. And if he intended it [i.e., the evil deed] and then performed it, then Allah writes it down as one evil deed. [2]\nAbu Huraira reported that Allah's Messenger (\ufdfa) said: When Allah created the creation as He was upon the Throne, He put down in His Book: Verily, My mercy predominates My wrath. [3]\nThe belief in Allah's mercy is beneficial to a believer because it causes an individual to reflect on their ability to be merciful themselves. Narrated Jarir bin Abdullah: Allah's Messenger (\ufdfa) said, \"Allah will not be merciful to those who are not merciful to mankind.\" [4] It also encourages a believer to do good, to act with virtue so that they can receive the mercy of their Lord, \"As for those who believe and do good, the Most Compassionate will certainly bless them with genuine love\" (Surah Maryam ayah 96) \nHadith References:\n[1] Sahih Bukhari 5653 Grade: Sahih (authentic) according to Al-Bukhari\n[2] Sahih al-Bukhari 6491 & Sahih Muslim 131a[3] Sahih Muslim 2751a\n[4]Sahih al-Bukhari 7376\n\n\n",

Ibn Arabi says Al-Malik is the one \"for whom nothing He wants to do in His Sovereign kingdom is difficult.\" All things in existence come from Him, and He presides as a sovereign ruler over them.\nThe Ruler or The King:There is a difference in \u0671\u0644\u0652\u0645\u064e\u0640\u0670\u0644\u0650\u0643\u064f (Al-Malik) and \u0671\u0644\u0652\u0645\u064e\u0640\u0627\u0644\u0650\u0643\u064f (Al-M\u0101lik), phonetically the difference is the second is said with a stress on the letter \"a\". Al-Malik is a king, a ruler over his subject whereas Al-M\u0101lik is the master and owner. Al-Malik is the king, whose limits are not confined to a boundary, He is ever-lasting in time and space. He can never be abdicated from His throne and doesn't need the support of His subjects. Our perception of a king is that he leads the people, but he requires buy-in from his subjects. Without the support of the people, he has no power, no dominion. Abu Dharr reported Allah's messenger \ufdfa as stating that God most high says, \"if the first and last of you, the living and the dead among you, those of you who are fresh and those of you who are withered, had all hearts as wretched as the heart of the most wretched of my servants, that would not diminish as much as a gnat\u2019s wing from my dominion.\"  [1]\nThis emphasizes how He has no need of any existing thing, He is independent. If all people were wretched in their hearts, i.e., they did not believe, He would still be the king. His dominion would not diminish even by a \"gnat's wing.\" In his book, The Name & the Named Shayk Tosun Bayrak writes, \"He does not need His kingdom, His kingdom needs Him. He rules by Himself; He does not need any help to rule. He has created the universe as a workplace for His creation, and He has created the day of judgment as a great court of justice.\"\n \u0641\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649 \u0671\u0644\u0644\u0651\u064e\u0647\u064f \u0671\u0644\u06e1\u0645\u064e\u0644\u0650\u0643\u064f \u0671\u0644\u06e1\u062d\u064e\u0642\u0651\u064f\u06d7 \u0648\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0627 \u062a\u064e\u0639\u06e1\u062c\u064e\u0644\u06e1 \u0628\u0650\u0671\u0644\u06e1\u0642\u064f\u0631\u06e1\u0621\u064e\u0627\u0646\u0650 \u0645\u0650\u0646 \u0642\u064e\u0628\u06e1\u0644\u0650 \u0623\u064e\u0646 \u064a\u064f\u0642\u06e1\u0636\u064e\u0649\u0670\u0653 \u0625\u0650\u0644\u064e\u064a\u06e1\u0643\u064e \u0648\u064e\u062d\u06e1\u064a\u064f\u0647\u064f\u06e5\u06d6 \u0648\u064e\u0642\u064f\u0644 \u0631\u0651\u064e\u0628\u0651\u0650 \u0632\u0650\u062f\u06e1\u0646\u0650\u064a \u0639\u0650\u0644\u06e1\u0645\u0657\u0627\nFata\u2019aalal laahul Malikul Haqq; wa laa ta\u2019jal bil Quraani min qabli ai yuqdaaa ilaika wahyuhoo wa qur Rabbi zidnee ilmaa\nEnglish Translation:\"So high [above all] is Allah, the Sovereign, the Truth.

Exalted is Allah above whatever they associate with Him.\" \u2014 (Qur'an 59:23)\nFrom the hadith, it mentions Allah's Messenger (\ufdfa) as saying, \"The most awful name in Allah's sight on the Day of Resurrection, will be (that of) a man calling himself Malik Al-Amlak (the King of kings). [2] There can be no King of kings, as Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 is the King of kings. To say otherwise would be blasphemous.\nReflection:Our belief and understanding that Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 is Al-Malik (The King) enables us to realize all matters we seek belong with Him. We see how this name encompasses an aura of grandness and majesty. He has complete knowledge, power, and rule over all His creation. So if we seek refuge, we should confide in Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 because only He can help provide relief. If we seek the bounty, we should ask from the King of kings because He is the only true provider with no limits.\nThis belief also frees us from the shackles of dependence on wealthy leaders that may cause us to compromise our morals and integrity so that we may be in their favor. People will continually try to use fame, money, and power to control and influence our behavior for their benefit. But for the person who knows Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 as Al-Malik, they can break hold from the power others may hold over us. They see the illusion and don't fall for their tricks.\nA person who has Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 only needs Allah; they are free from worldly desires and can find happiness within.

Al-Quddus is the superlative which captures His essence of perfection. He is far removed from resembling anything. Imam al-Ghazali writes in his treatise of the 99 names, \"the Holy is the one who transcends every one of the attributes of perfection which the majority of creatures thinks of as perfection.\"\nThe Holy Spirit:The Qur'an mentions the concept of the Holy Spirit (Ruh Al-Quddus) four times. It is understood that He purifies and makes holy through this spirit. This is the concept of the divine force and influence Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 has over His creatures. Whenever you see either Ruh al-Quddus or Ruh al-Amin (the faithful or trustworthy spirit, see 26:193 for example) the commentators of the Qur'an interpret it as being interchangeable with the Angel Jibrel.\nIn the tafsir of Ibn Kathir for Surah Maidah ayah 110, \"O Isa, son of Maryam! Remember My favor to you and to your mother when I supported you with Ruh il-Qudus (Jibril) so that you spoke to the people in the cradle and in maturity [...] and you healed those born blind, and the lepers by My permission, and when you brought forth the dead by My permission;\"\nWhen Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 mentions the passing of this spirit it's understood as to cast a reflection of His divine characteristics on His creation.

[2]\nIt was narrated from Ubayy bin Ka'b that: The Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) used to pray witr with three rak'ahs. In the first he would recite: \"Glorify the Name of Your Lord, the Most High\" in the second: \"Say: O you disbelievers!\", and in the third: \"Say: He is Allah, (the) One\". And he would say the Qunut before bowing, and when he finished he would say: Subhanal-Malikil-Quddus (Glory be to the Sovereign, the Most Holy) three times, elongating the words the last time.

This is a lifelong journey of freeing ourselves from desires and avoiding anger, lust, and addictions to food or clothing. Instead, be engaged in tawbah, i.e., seek Allah's forgiveness, for He can cleanse you of any mistakes or wrongdoings. He can guide the one who is lost. As we'll explore in later sections, the name Al-Afuww, the effacer of sins - He pardons any sin and leaves no trace of any fault. Remember, Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 is Al-Quddus, the pure and the Holy, and He created you. There's a purpose and wisdom for your existence. We may not understand it or seem lost at times.

As-Salam refers to the attribute of Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 as the source of this peace. The word Islam also shares the same root of s-l-m which encompasses the concept of peace which is one of core principles of the religion. This name also implies the idea of \"soundness\" or \"wholesomeness,\" i.e., being flawless, free from blemishes. He is complete and whole. Nothing depletes Him as He is self-sufficient.

Thauban reported: When the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) finished his prayer. He begged forgiveness three times and said: (Allahumma Antas-Salam wa minkas-salam. Tabarakta ya Dhal-jalali wal-Ikram.) O Allah! Thou art Peace, and peace comes from Thee; Blessed art Thou, O Possessor of Glory and Honour. Walid reported: I said to Auza'i: How is the seeking of forgiveness? He replied: You should say: I beg forgiveness from Allah, I beg forgiveness from Allah.\" [2]\nReflection:We can benefit from knowing As-Salam by working daily to attain peace. This process involves freeing the heart and mind from silly games with no upside, like jealousy, envy, and revenge. As the saying goes, \"resentment is like drinking poison and then hoping it will kill your enemies.\" This is not the way to achieve peace. Be forgiving of yourself and others. Focus your effort to try and become as close to flawless as you can get. Work to minimize all your imperfections. When a person can love himself and love others, he will naturally bring peace to the earth.\nThe Prophet \ufdfa also characterized the believer as a being safe. It was narrated from Abu Hurairah that: The Messenger of Allah \ufdfa said: \"The Muslim is the one from whose tongue and hand the people are safe, and the believer is the one from whom the people's lives and wealth are safe.\" [3]\nAnas reported that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, \"As-Salam (peace) is one of the Names of Allah Almighty which Allah has placed in the earth. Therefore give the greeting among yourselves\" [4] and \"Abu Huraira reported: The Messenger of Allah (may peace and blessing be upon him) observed: You shall not enter Paradise so long as you do not affirm belief (in all those things which are the articles of faith) and you will not believe as long as you do not love one another. Should I not direct you to a thing which, if you do, will foster love amongst you: (i.e.) give currency to (the practice of paying salutation to one another by saying) as-salamu alaikum.\" [5]\nReferences:\n[1] Sahih al-Bukhari 831\n[2] Sahih Muslim 591\n[3] Sahih (Darussalam) Sunan an-Nasa'i 4995\n[4] Hasan (Al-Albani) Al-Adab Al-Mufrad 989\n[5] Sahih Muslim 54a\n\n\n",

As we grow more acquainted with His essence, we can feel our relationship with Him transform and become more secure. The sixth name of Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 is Al-Mu'min which is the quality that has enabled the hearts to experience this feeling and brought us together. Al-Mu'min is the inspirer of faith and the giver of security. He's the one who's sent down His book and Messengers with signs of clear proof for all who'd listen. Some of Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 names can have many meanings or interpretations. Al-Mu'min is one of those names.\nHe is the one who provides justice and security to His creations. He fulfills all His promises and will never punish any creature unfairly. He is as His servant expects Him to be, \"Indeed, Allah does not do injustice, [even] as much as an atom\u2019s weight; while if there is a good deed, He multiplies it and gives from Himself a great reward.\" (Qur'an 4:40) This sentiment is repeated in Surah Ghafir verse 17, \"This Day every soul will be recompensed for what it earned. No injustice today! Indeed, Allah is swift in account.\"\nThe Qur'an repeatedly mentions the believer as mu'min, so how do we then ascribe this name as an attribute of Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670? First, the context is completely different; what's true for one does not mean it's true for the other. In reality, there is no comparison with Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 with anything. Mumin is derived from amana or imaan, meaning security, surety, and/or peace. When it refers to the believer, it means the one who attests to what is true (i.e., the six articles of faith - (1) Belief in God, (2) Angels, (3) Books, (4) Messengers, (5) Day of Judgment, and (6) His Divine Decree). When it applies to Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670, it is the one who confirms Himself as being true.

Even if he could move, he still had no weapons or soldiers to fight with. Even if he had weapons or an able army he could not guarantee victory. Then someone comes to his rescue, attends to him in his weakness, provides him a big sturdy fortress, soldiers, and weapons, and grants him complete security and safety. The only befitting name for such a person would be \"the faithful\".\nImam Ghazali continues, \"Man is basically weak by nature.\" Our being compared to other creations seems like we are strong in the hierarchy of the animal kingdom, but in many ways, we are also fragile. The Qur'an even mentions this fact:\n \u064a\u064f\u0631\u0650\u064a\u062f\u064f \u0671\u0644\u0644\u0651\u064e\u0647\u064f \u0623\u064e\u0646 \u064a\u064f\u062e\u064e\u0641\u0651\u0650\u0641\u064e \u0639\u064e\u0646\u0643\u064f\u0645\u06e1\u06da \u0648\u064e\u062e\u064f\u0644\u0650\u0642\u064e \u0671\u0644\u06e1\u0625\u0650\u0646\u0633\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064f \u0636\u064e\u0639\u0650\u064a\u0641\u0657\u0627\nYureedul laahu ai yukhaffifa \u2018ankum; wa khuliqal insaanu da\u2019eefaa\nEnglish Translation:\"And Allah wants to lighten for you [your difficulties]; and mankind was created weak.\" \u2014 (Qur'an 4:28)\nThere exists many threats to our well-being. We have deadly diseases and infections, suffering from thirst and hunger, fear of fatal accidents, wars, and riots. It's a never-ending anxiety-inducing list. This is just phsyical realm of weakness. Then there's a spiritual aspect of being weak in regards to controlling one's desires, impulses, emotions, etc. Shaykh Tosun Bayrak said regarding this, \"the worst of these enemies are our own egos and the accursed Devil. The tyrants, the maligners, the envious, come after them.\"\nAllah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 is the only one who can protect us from all forms of harm and adversity. The Qur'an mentions how the people of Quraysh had their fears removed and prospered after the du'a Prophet Ibrahim (as) made.

If we see injustice, we should not remain silent. In whatever capacity we can help and try to make a difference, we should. This name, Al-Mu'min, can be invoked in any prayer. Still, it should be kept in mind by anyone experiencing fear or insecurity as a reminder to call upon Allah for protection, \"Oh Allah!

Nothing can be kept a secret from Him. \"He knows what is in the heavens and earth; He knows what you conceal and what you reveal; God knows very well the secrets of every heart.\" (64:4)\nYou can find variations of the word muhaymin, like muhaiminan in Surah Maidah verse 48 where Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 declares the Qur'an as being the book that will be well-guarded over the other books:\nMuhsin Khan Translation:\"And We have sent down to you (O Muhammad \ufdfa) the Book (this Quran) in truth, confirming the Scripture that came before it and Mohayminan (trustworthy in highness and a witness) over it (old Scriptures).\"\nBut as a name and attribute of Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670, Al-Muhaymin is only ever mentioned once in the Qur'an.\n \u0647\u064f\u0648\u064e \u0671\u0644\u0644\u0651\u064e\u0647\u064f \u0671\u0644\u0651\u064e\u0630\u0650\u064a \u0644\u064e\u0627\u0653 \u0625\u0650\u0644\u064e\u0670\u0647\u064e \u0625\u0650\u0644\u0651\u064e\u0627 \u0647\u064f\u0648\u064e \u0671\u0644\u06e1\u0645\u064e\u0644\u0650\u0643\u064f \u0671\u0644\u06e1\u0642\u064f\u062f\u0651\u064f\u0648\u0633\u064f \u0671\u0644\u0633\u0651\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0670\u0645\u064f \u0671\u0644\u06e1\u0645\u064f\u0624\u06e1\u0645\u0650\u0646\u064f \u0671\u0644\u06e1\u0645\u064f\u0647\u064e\u064a\u06e1\u0645\u0650\u0646\u064f \u0671\u0644\u06e1\u0639\u064e\u0632\u0650\u064a\u0632\u064f \u0671\u0644\u06e1\u062c\u064e\u0628\u0651\u064e\u0627\u0631\u064f \u0671\u0644\u06e1\u0645\u064f\u062a\u064e\u0643\u064e\u0628\u0651\u0650\u0631\u064f\u06da \u0633\u064f\u0628\u06e1\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e \u0671\u0644\u0644\u0651\u064e\u0647\u0650 \u0639\u064e\u0645\u0651\u064e\u0627 \u064a\u064f\u0634\u06e1\u0631\u0650\u0643\u064f\u0648\u0646\u064e\nHuwal-laahul-lazee laaa Ilaaha illaa Huwal-Malikul Quddoosus-Salaamul Muminul Muhaiminul-aAzeezul Jabbaarul-Mutakabbir; Subhaanal laahi Ammaa yushrikoon\nEnglish Translation:\"He is Allah, other than whom there is no deity, the Sovereign, the Pure, the Perfection, the Bestower of Faith, the Overseer, the Exalted in Might, the Compeller, the Superior. Exalted is Allah above whatever they associate with Him.\" \u2014 (Qur'an 59:23)\n\n\nA sense of ownership/authority:The word \u0647\u064a\u0645\u0646\u0629 (transliteration: haymana) in modern Arabic means dominance. One country can seize another, being in control or showing authority over that state. But this is often transitory, exchanging hands from one \"owner\" to another. Only Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 is Al-Muhaymin, the one who has complete guardianship, a quality of being in control, supremely that lasts for eternity. It is not limited by any means.\nBut this is one form of dominance. Muhaymin also refers to an authoritative figure who reigns supreme, one that you can trust. This is analogous to a parent who out of love for their child will set rules and boundaries to protect and care for the child. It's often done in the best interest despite the kid thinking otherwise. Imam Al-Ghazali says, \"Everyone who has complete command of a situation, who takes possession of it and protects it, will be its 'Guardian.' taking command comes down to knowledge, possession to the perfection of power, and protection to action. The one who unites these meanings is named Guardian. But only God - great and glorious - joins them absolutely and perfectly.\"\nReflection:How do we benefit from knowing that Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 is Al-Muhaymin? Just as Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 is the overseer of all His creation, we need to be watchful over ourselves. Many people do not know themselves - they think they are their thoughts. We can let horrible or negative thoughts come to mind, but we don't have to identify with them. We can let it come and pass, just like how a river flows. Identification, thinking you are your thoughts, is like a beaver building a dam in the river. This only ends up damaging the surrounding environment.\nSimilarly, identification can be destructive, leading to either a depressive state or causing one to become arrogant or narcissistic. Instead, it is better to try and be indifferent. Take time to observe and watch your thoughts come and go. Ask where and why they may have arisen. Analyze their depths, and you may uncover secrets about yourself hiding in your psyche. Imam Ghazali recognizes this watching as a crucial step in reforming oneself, allowing one to become a guardian over his or her heart. Only selectively choosing thoughts that are constructive and letting everything else go.\nAnother way in which one can try to characterize themselves by this name is to be observant of those around you. People in passing will reveal certain pains and troubles. If you are watchful, you can exhibit a Prophetic tradition of the Prophet Muhammad \ufdfa which was to care for the needs of those around him. In this sense, you are a guardian, being watchful and showing care and compassion to those around you.\n\n",

He is also the ever watchful. Nothing that can be hidden from Him, He is the knower of all the secrets we conceal."

Common translations include The Almighty, The Mighty One, or The Eminent One. The word Azeez comes from izzat meaning honor and nobility.\nThe divine pairing of names:This great name of Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 appears approximately 90 times in the Qur'an. It's often paired with another name, for example, Al-Aziz Al-Rahim, Al-Aziz Al-Hakeem, Al-Aziz Al-Ghaffar, or Al-Aziz Al-Wahhab. The pairing of names oftens conveys an additional layer, we learn something new about Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 that would often be overlooked if we just studied these names independently.\nFor example, what does it mean to be Al-Aziz Al-Rahim?

Yet to those who deny and to those who disbelieve, He is always merciful first. \"My mercy predominates My wrath\" [1] He does not hasten to punish the one who errs but gives them time to repent. And even when He punishes the transgressors, He can be most severe, but He punishes with mercy. These meanings are said to be divinely designed, whose perfection in meaning is understood best through the pairing of names.\n \u0623\u064e\u0645\u06e1 \u0639\u0650\u0646\u062f\u064e\u0647\u064f\u0645\u06e1 \u062e\u064e\u0632\u064e\u0627\u0653\u0626\u0650\u0646\u064f \u0631\u064e\u062d\u06e1\u0645\u064e\u0629\u0650 \u0631\u064e\u0628\u0651\u0650\u0643\u064e \u0671\u0644\u06e1\u0639\u064e\u0632\u0650\u064a\u0632\u0650 \u0671\u0644\u06e1\u0648\u064e\u0647\u0651\u064e\u0627\u0628\u0650\nAm\u2019indahum khazaaa \u2018inu rahmati Rabbikal Azeezil Wahhab\nEnglish Translation:\"Or do they have the depositories of the mercy of your Lord, the Exalted in Might, the Bestower?\" \u2014 (Qur'an 38:9)\nThe Pairing Al-Azeez and Al-Hakeem:\n \u0648\u064e\u0644\u0650\u0644\u0651\u064e\u0647\u0650 \u062c\u064f\u0646\u064f\u0648\u062f\u064f \u0671\u0644\u0633\u0651\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0670\u0648\u064e\u0670\u062a\u0650 \u0648\u064e\u0671\u0644\u06e1\u0623\u064e\u0631\u06e1\u0636\u0650\u06da \u0648\u064e\u0643\u064e\u0627\u0646\u064e \u0671\u0644\u0644\u0651\u064e\u0647\u064f \u0639\u064e\u0632\u0650\u064a\u0632\u064b\u0627 \u062d\u064e\u0643\u0650\u064a\u0645\u064b\u0627\nWa lillaahi junoodus samaawaati wal ard; wa kaanal laahu azeezan hakeema\nEnglish Translation:\"And to Allah belong the soldiers of the heavens and the earth.

We can supplicate using this name if we wish to be mighty. It's natural to aspire for wealth, success, or prestige. It's a noble cause, especially if the goal of attainment is using that wealth to further Islam and/or to help others.

Exalted is Allah above whatever they associate with Him.\" \u2014 (Qur'an 59:23)\nVerses that describe Allah (\u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670) decree:There are other verses that we can examine which helps us understand what it means to be Al-Jabbar. For example, in Surah Insan verse 30, \"And you do not will except that Allah wills. Indeed, Allah is ever Knowing and Wise.\" Allah is the one who compels us. We don't get to choose where we're born, who our parents are, our physical traits, or the quirks that make us uniquely us. We don't fully understand the intricacies of our anatomy, the beating of the heart, the firing of our nerves, and the conception of a new baby. All these details of perfection which we're unaware of are because Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 has compelled it to be that way. In Surah Yaseen, \"His command is only when He intends a thing that He says to it, 'Be,' and it is.\" (Qur'an 36:82)\nA second meaning:There is a second meaning to Al-Jabbar: the one who restores, resets, or fixes our brokenness. He fixes by force and changes the state of something that is disordered and sets it right. Therefore, we can make du'a with this name when you want something in your life restored or fixed. Just as he compels a thing, He can put our lives in order. He is the only one who can mend what is broken, and restore what is lost.\n\n\nReflection:When we come to know Al-Jabbar, we realize Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 as having extreme power, supremacy, strength over all His creation. Imam Al-Ghazali says, \"praised and exalted - for He compels each thing and nothing compels Him, and He has no competitor on either score.\" In coming to realize this, we are subdued. We can no longer believe in our superiority. We understand that He is the one who elevated our rank. He benefits His creation but needs no benefitting Himself. This name can be a reminder not to inflate your ego and to avoid self-aggrandizement, \"Thus does Allah seal over every heart [belonging to] an arrogant tyrant.\" (Qur'an 40:35)\nSupplications from Hadith:\nWe should call upon this name for help in desperation. A cry to Al-Jabbar to remedy a broken heart, marriage, or confidence. In a weak hadith narration, \"Ibn Abbas narrated: 'Between the two prostrations, the Prophet would say: (Allahummaghfir li, warhamni, wajburni, wahdini, warzuqni). 'O Allah! Pardon me, have mercy on me, help me, guide me, and grant me sustenance.' [1]\n\n \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0651\u0647\u064f\u0640\u0645\u0651\u064e \u0627\u063a\u0652\u0641\u0650\u0640\u0631\u0652 \u0644\u064a  \u0648\u064e\u0627\u0631\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0645\u0652\u0640\u0646\u064a  \u0648\u064e\u0627\u0647\u0652\u062f\u0650\u0646\u0640\u064a  \u0648\u064e\u0627\u062c\u0652\u0628\u064f\u0631\u0652\u0646\u0640\u064a  \u0648\u064e\u0639\u0627\u0641\u0650\u0646\u0640\u064a \u0648\u064e\u0627\u0631\u0652\u0632\u064f\u0642\u0652\u0646\u0640\u064a \u0648\u064e\u0627\u0631\u0652\u0641\u064e\u0639\u0652\u0640\u0646\u064a\nAll\u0101humma\u2019ghfir l\u012b, war\u2019\u1e25amn\u012b. wahdin\u012b, wajburn\u012b. wa `\u0101fin\u012b, warzuqn\u012b, warfa`n\u012b.\nEnglish Translation:\"O Allah forgive me, have mercy on me, guide me, support me, protect me, provide for me, and elevate me.\"\nHere wajaburni means to help or rectify me - which aligns with the meaning of Al-Jabbar being the restorer/repairer. Although this narration is da'if (weak), the supplication is still very much relevant. A word of caution, repeating this in your prostration would be ritualizing something unsound, and it's not the way to reach definitive practices taught by rasulullah. If you do so because, at the moment, your heart desires to supplicate in prostration, and you recite this particular du'a because it comes to your mind, then that's fine. It's still a beneficial act that praises Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670. The words of dhikr are still applicable, but ritually doing something off of a weak hadith is generally not advisable.\nIn another narration from Hudhaifah: He prayed with the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) one night, and he heard him say when he said the Takbir: \"Allahu Akbara dhal-jabaruti wal-malakuti wal-kibriya'i wal-'azamah (Allah is Most Great, the One Who has all power, sovereignty, magnificence and might).\" When bowing, he would say: \"Subhana Rabbiyal-'Azim (Glory be to my Lord Almighty).\" When he raised his head from bowing, he would say: \"Lirabbil-hamd, Lirabbil-hamd (To my Lord be praise, to my Lord be praise).\" And when he prostrated (he said): \"Subhana Rabbiyal-A'la (Glory be to my Lord Most High).\" And between the two prostrations (he said): \"Rabbighfirli, Rabbighfirli (Lord forgive me, Lord forgive me).\" His standing, his bowing, when he raised his head from bowing, his prostration, and the time between the two prostrations were almost the same.

Exalted is Allah above whatever they associate with Him.\" \u2014 (Qur'an 59:23)\nThe idea behind the name of Al-Mutakabbir, meaning \"The Proud,\" is that Allah alone possesses greatness; no one can compete with Him. Abu Sa'id Khudri and Abu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (\ufdfa) as saying: Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, said: Glory is His lower garment and Majesty is His cloak and (Allah says,) He who contends with Me in regard to them I shall torment him. [1]\nNow, if you were the best in a particular field or sport, we're talking complete domination; no one comes close to winning. Wouldn't you feel proud of your ability and achievements? In this regard, Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 is said to be proud. Imam Ghazali explains Al-Mutakabbir as the one \"Who sees greatness and Majesty only in regard to himself, and looks upon others as a king looks upon his servants. And if his assessment be correct, he will be truly proud.\"\n\n\nAvoid Arrogance:Note the emphasis on \"...if his assessment be correct\" imagine if the presumptions of greatness were false, then that person is due for a rude awakening. This is the story of Iblis. He was the first to claim arrogance. He believed he was great in exclusion of all else, and he was humiliated by Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670. This danger looms true for all. Don't become arrogant, and believe in your superiority. Those who do fail to realize it was from Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 and not their own doing.\nEven Firawn, the king of Egypt, likened himself to a God. But where are all the caesars and dictators now? What empires still stand that honor, worship, and praise them daily? Their pride became arrogance which was based on faulty presumptions. They believed they had no one to answer to, \"Thus does Allah seal over every heart [belonging to] an (mutakabbirin jabbaar) arrogant tyrant.\" (Qur'an 40:35) In the tafsir of Abul-Maududi it says of this verse, \"the seal is not set on the heart of anybody without a reason. This seal of curse is set only on the heart of the one who is filled with arrogance and spirit of violence and tyranny.\" In another ayah, \"But Moses said, 'Indeed, I have sought refuge in my Lord and your Lord from every arrogant one who does not believe in the Day of Account.\" (Qur'an 40:27)\nReflection:A lesson to be learned is as you grow skilled in a field, it's natural that you'd get more confident. But when you start to think of yourself as an expert, you make yourself vulnerable, hence the saying, \"it's the strong swimmers who drown.\" It's the strong swimmers who take more risks and, as a result, face fatal accidents. It's too late for them, and their fate is sealed. Similarly, what's better for the believer is to focus on finding truth. To avoid arrogance in thinking that they already know.\nThe human condition is a desire to know, expand, and have power. It's hard to renounce all things - which, if you could, would be better. But that's the road less traveled. It's difficult and discomforting to assume you don't know or to admit you are uncertain. It feels reassuring to think you know something. But in this facade, you deprive yourself of going further. The tricky part of having poor judgment is you don't know when you have it. It's far better to find evidence in reality to support your view - and even then, not to draw conclusions. The moment you feel you know something, you allow yourself to stop searching.\nWe all likely share a similar experience in studying for a test. You may have gone over a homework problem, looked at the answer, and thought, \"yeah that make sense\" or \"that's easy,\" and moved on. But when a similar question appeared on the test, we \"blanked out\" and couldn't answer it. Really we just fooled ourselves into thinking we knew and never got evidence to support that we really did. It would've been wise to test and practice, space out some time, and do it again. This way, we would not fool ourselves into thinking we knew something when we really didn't.\nTo try and characterize oneself as being great and as feeling proud of their achievements in a non-conceited way, we can simplify it to the basic philosophy of doing your best. Be clear and deliberate in understanding what's important to you, and then try your best to live up to that standard. If you could go to bed every day knowing you've done your best, how can you not say you succeeded in what you set out to do? As a result of doing this over an extended period, you will surely get recognition from those closest to you, and perhaps it will shine through for others to see as well. But that part is something that will happen as a by-product, not as the goal for attainment. More important to ask how to be deserving of greatness rather than a desire for greatness.\nIn another light, Al-Mutakabbir is also the one we can lean on when we are faced with an obstacle that seems insurmountable. It's a name that should inspire hope and optimism.

            "mentions-from-quran-hadith": "\n\nArabic Root:From the Arabic root kha-lam-qaf (\u062e \u0644 \u0642), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to measure accurately, to determine the proper measure or proportion for something, to proportion one thing according to another, to create something based on a pattern or model which one has devised, to bring a thing into existence from non-existence.\nThe names of creation:The name Al-Khaliq is mentioned in the Qur'an 8 times. The three names of creation, Al-Khaliq (The Creator), Al-Bari (The Producer), and Al-Musawwir (The Fashioner). These names may seem synonymous with Allah's ability to invent or create. But they are distinct names offering unique shades of meaning, bringing out different aspects to Allah's creating of creation. For example, these three names are often said to represent an order to His creation. First, you have Al-Khaliq, The Creator. He who produces something from nothing, i.e., He plans and creates. Secondly, He is Al-Bari, The Producer - the one who initiates and brings into existence. Lastly, He is Al-Musawwir, The Fashioner - He organizes and shapes the arrangement of the creation.\nWhat's amazing is these names are followed in this exact sequence based on their meaning in in the following ayah:\n \u0647\u064f\u0648\u064e \u0671\u0644\u0644\u0651\u064e\u0647\u064f \u0671\u0644\u06e1\u062e\u064e\u0670\u0644\u0650\u0642\u064f \u0671\u0644\u06e1\u0628\u064e\u0627\u0631\u0650\u0626\u064f \u0671\u0644\u06e1\u0645\u064f\u0635\u064e\u0648\u0651\u0650\u0631\u064f\u06d6 \u0644\u064e\u0647\u064f \u0671\u0644\u06e1\u0623\u064e\u0633\u06e1\u0645\u064e\u0627\u0653\u0621\u064f \u0671\u0644\u06e1\u062d\u064f\u0633\u06e1\u0646\u064e\u0649\u0670\u06da \u064a\u064f\u0633\u064e\u0628\u0651\u0650\u062d\u064f \u0644\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0645\u064e\u0627 \u0641\u0650\u064a \u0671\u0644\u0633\u0651\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0670\u0648\u064e\u0670\u062a\u0650 \u0648\u064e\u0671\u0644\u06e1\u0623\u064e\u0631\u06e1\u0636\u0650\u06d6 \u0648\u064e\u0647\u064f\u0648\u064e \u0671\u0644\u06e1\u0639\u064e\u0632\u0650\u064a\u0632\u064f \u0671\u0644\u06e1\u062d\u064e\u0643\u0650\u064a\u0645\u064f\nHuwal Laahul Khaaliqul Baari ul Musawwir; lahul Asmaaa'ul Husnaa; yusabbihu lahoo maa fis samaawaati wal ardi wa Huwal Azeezul Hakeem\nEnglish Translation:\"He is Allah, the Creator, the Inventor, the Fashioner; to Him belong the best names. Whatever is in the heavens and earth is exalting Him. And He is the Exalted in Might, the Wise.\" \u2014 (Qur'an 59:24)\nA useful analogy:Imam al-Ghazali compares these three names to the process of constructing a house. You have the planner, the builder, and the designer who gives it its final shape. Similarly, Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 takes on the three roles - the creator, producer, and the fashioner. However, the difference is we are not really inventing. Only Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 creates and He does so on an unimaginable scale. He creates from nothingness, whereas we are merely finding ways to transform material from one form to another. We are limited in what we can make, whereas Allah's creation is unbounded.\n\n\nNo single creation exists without His willingness for it to be.

It's also mentioned another time in Surah as-Saffat ayat 125.\nNote how, in the following ayah, it pairs these two attributes of His, i.e., He is Al-Khaliq, and Al-Alim (the knower). It signifies His ability to create in abundance and in accordance with His master plan. He creates perpetually and with a purpose. \"Did you imagine that We created you without any purpose, and that you will not be brought back to Us?\" (Qur'an 23:115)\n \u0625\u0650\u0646\u0651\u064e \u0631\u064e\u0628\u0651\u064e\u0643\u064e \u0647\u064f\u0648\u064e \u0671\u0644\u06e1\u062e\u064e\u0644\u0651\u064e\u0640\u0670\u0642\u064f \u0671\u0644\u06e1\u0639\u064e\u0644\u0650\u064a\u0645\u064f\nInna Rabbaka Huwal khallaaqul \u2018aleem\nEnglish Translation:\"For verily it is thy Lord who is the Master-Creator, knowing all things.\" \u2014 (Qur'an 15:86)\nReflection:If we take a second to reflect on all of Allah's creations. How can a person be created from a small drop of fluid and have it manifest into 30 trillion cells that all work in unison, giving us life? If you gaze at the night sky, look at each tiny speck of light, each one of those is a giant star existing far away in some galaxy Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 has created. Yet here we are on this relatively small rock, floating through space, and it's the only one we know that is habitable. All the beauty in the world, and you get to experience it; Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 has allowed us to play a part in it. How can you not feel humble and appreciative of this very moment? The pessimist says, 'but think of all the fitnahs (i.e., trials or tests) of the world'. A person can look through a window and appreciate the beauty outside, but it is possible to fixate only on the specks that dirty the glass. Whatever you focus on, you will see.\nFurther Reading: we did not include all the verses which mentions the name, Al-khaliq.

We can not change it, nor should there be a desire to. Instead, we should learn to love it, look after it, and accept it for what it is. This process doesn't happen overnight; there's no guilt in not feeling great immediately. But, through studying deen, we understand Allah's attributes of how He is all-Knowing, doesn't make mistakes, and that He is the best of creators. We must then examine our insecurities and put them under a microscope. Here we will find that we are all perfectly imperfect.

The suffering we experience in our self-image is of the mind, and this differs from reality. The ways we are imperfect are through our actions and the way we treat ourselves. These actions can erode self-respect and dignity - perhaps on a subconscious level. But, if we are honest, we can figure out what may be causing our unhappiness/uneasiness and seek to better ourselves. We don't have to deny our weaknesses; instead, we should embrace them.

There will be less of an internal conflict to do the things you already know you should be doing the day you revitalize the love of self.

This is what it means to be fooled by the worldly life - the cars, the money, beauty standards, fame, or popularity. All these are superficial. You don't need to define yourself by these values. Instead, you can rewrite your story for confidence to be defined by your loving nature, piousness, devotion to Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670, your compassion, your mercy, your wisdom, your family values, and/or your hard-working and resourceful nature. Notice how all these are internal values that occur at the individual level. It doesn't involve other people or require an outwardly show of something. There is no competition with others. This makes it less glamorized and promoted in culture, as there's nothing for them to sell you and to make a profit on. If anything, perfecting oneself can make others feel inferior, so it's looked down on.\nNarrated Ibn Abbas: that the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said: \"Love Allah for what He nourishes you with of His Blessings, love me due to the love of Allah, and love the people of my house due to the love of me.\" [1]\nReferences:\n[1] Hasan (Darussalam) Jami` at-Tirmidhi 3789\n\n\n",

You can read the benefits of knowing these names, as we already discussed in Al-Khaliq and Al-Bari. We can take with us a lesson from the life of Prophet Suleiman (as). Remember this as you read this next section, Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 is the fashioner; he forms us unique and however, He pleases.\nProphet Suleiman (as) was a wealthy King, ruling over the Israelites, loved by the people, and endowed with many unique abilities. The Qur'an says that he gifted \"the language of the birds.\" We also learn that he could hear the ants when they spoke and that he could command the Jinn. Moreover, he was wise, \"And We had certainly given to David and Solomon knowledge\" (27:15). Do you think he cultivated this ability on his own? No, of course not. These are the gifts that only the creator can bestow. Prophet Suleiman (as) knew this himself, which is why he made the following du'a which we are told in Surah Naml:\n \u0641\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0628\u064e\u0633\u0651\u064e\u0645\u064e \u0636\u064e\u0627\u062d\u0650\u0643\u0657\u0627 \u0645\u0651\u0650\u0646 \u0642\u064e\u0648\u06e1\u0644\u0650\u0647\u064e\u0627 \u0648\u064e\u0642\u064e\u0627\u0644\u064e  \u0631\u064e\u0628\u0651\u0650 \u0623\u064e\u0648\u06e1\u0632\u0650\u0639\u06e1\u0646\u0650\u064a\u0653 \u0623\u064e\u0646\u06e1 \u0623\u064e\u0634\u06e1\u0643\u064f\u0631\u064e \u0646\u0650\u0639\u06e1\u0645\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0643\u064e \u0671\u0644\u0651\u064e\u062a\u0650\u064a\u0653 \u0623\u064e\u0646\u06e1\u0639\u064e\u0645\u06e1\u062a\u064e \u0639\u064e\u0644\u064e\u064a\u0651\u064e \u0648\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 \u0648\u064e\u0670\u0644\u0650\u062f\u064e\u064a\u0651\u064e \u0648\u064e\u0623\u064e\u0646\u06e1 \u0623\u064e\u0639\u06e1\u0645\u064e\u0644\u064e \u0635\u064e\u0670\u0644\u0650\u062d\u0657\u0627 \u062a\u064e\u0631\u06e1\u0636\u064e\u0649\u0670\u0647\u064f \u0648\u064e\u0623\u064e\u062f\u06e1\u062e\u0650\u0644\u06e1\u0646\u0650\u064a \u0628\u0650\u0631\u064e\u062d\u06e1\u0645\u064e\u062a\u0650\u0643\u064e \u0641\u0650\u064a \u0639\u0650\u0628\u064e\u0627\u062f\u0650\u0643\u064e \u0671\u0644\u0635\u0651\u064e\u0640\u0670\u0644\u0650\u062d\u0650\u064a\u0646\u064e\nFatabassama daahikam min qawlihaa wa qaala Rabbi awzi'nee an ashkura ni'mata kal lateee an'amta alaiya wa alaa waalidaiya wa an a'mala saalihan tardaahu wa adkhilnee birahmatika fee ibaadikas saaliheen\nEnglish Translation:\"So [Solomon] smiled, amused at her speech, and said, 'My Lord, enable me to be grateful for Your favor which You have bestowed upon me and upon my parents and to do righteousness of which You approve.

Together they have been mentioned a total of 97 times in the Qur'an. Of those 97 instances, the Qur'an mentions Al-Ghaffur 91 times, Al-Ghaffar 5 times, and Al-Ghafir just once.\nAllah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 loves to forgive:These names refer to Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 nature of being forgiving. He wants to forgive those who seek istighfar (forgiveness). Anas (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah \ufdfa said, \"Allah, the Exalted, has said: 'O son of adam, I forgive you as long as you pray to Me and hope for My forgiveness, whatever sins you have committed. O son of 'Adam, I do not care if your sins reach the height of the heaven, then you ask for my forgiveness, I would forgive you. O son of 'Adam, if you come to Me with an earth load of sins, and meet Me associating nothing to Me, I would match it with an earthload of forgiveness.\"' [1]\nFrom this hadith, we learn that it's never too late for someone who seeks the forgiveness of their Lord, even if their sins \"reach the height of the heaven.\" Do not ever feel you are overburdening, asking for too much, or it's too late. This would be insulting to Allah's mercy, who is Al-Ghaffar, The Oft-Forgiving, the one who forgives perpetually. A person who has sinned should not despair of Allah's mercy. We are told in the following verse the one who sins has only wronged themselves when they disobey Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670.

In the Qur'an, it says, \"Indeed, Allah does not forgive association with Him, but He forgives what is less than that for whom He wills. And he who associates others with Allah has certainly fabricated a tremendous sin\" (Qur'an 4:48) and in another verse, \"Indeed, Allah does not forgive association with Him, but He forgives what is less than that for whom He wills. And he who associates others with Allah has certainly gone far astray.\" (Qur'an 4:116) But as other commentators have pointed out in Surah Az-Zumar, \"Indeed, Allah forgives all sins.\" All the sahabah before the Prophet's time were considered mushrikeen, but they changed, they sought forgiveness, and Allah forgave them. The Qur'an only speaks of the person not being forgiven if they died having committed shirk (e.g., Prophet Ibrahim AS father who died a pagan) and chose to reject or deny Islam.\nThe remaining Quranic verses that include the name Al-Ghaffar.\n \u0648\u064e\u0625\u0650\u0646\u0651\u0650\u064a \u0644\u064e\u063a\u064e\u0641\u0651\u064e\u0627\u0631\u065e \u0644\u0651\u0650\u0645\u064e\u0646 \u062a\u064e\u0627\u0628\u064e \u0648\u064e\u0621\u064e\u0627\u0645\u064e\u0646\u064e \u0648\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0645\u0650\u0644\u064e \u0635\u064e\u0670\u0644\u0650\u062d\u0657\u0627 \u062b\u064f\u0645\u0651\u064e \u0671\u0647\u06e1\u062a\u064e\u062f\u064e\u0649\u0670\nWa innee la Ghaffaarul liman taaba wa aamana wa \u2018amila saalihan summah tadaa\nEnglish Translation:\"But indeed, I am the Perpetual Forgiver of whoever repents and believes and does righteousness and then continues in guidance.\" \u2014 (Qur'an 20:82)\n\n\n \u0631\u064e\u0628\u0651\u064f \u0671\u0644\u0633\u0651\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0670\u0648\u064e\u0670\u062a\u0650 \u0648\u064e\u0671\u0644\u06e1\u0623\u064e\u0631\u06e1\u0636\u0650 \u0648\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0627 \u0628\u064e\u064a\u06e1\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u0645\u064e\u0627 \u0671\u0644\u06e1\u0639\u064e\u0632\u0650\u064a\u0632\u064f \u0671\u0644\u06e1\u063a\u064e\u0641\u0651\u064e\u0640\u0670\u0631\u064f\nRabbus samaawaati wal ardi wa maa bainahumal Azeezul Ghaffaar\nEnglish Translation:\"Lord of the heavens and the earth and whatever is between them, the Exalted in Might, the Perpetual Forgiver.\" \u2014 (Qur'an 38:66)\n \u062e\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0642\u064e \u0671\u0644\u0633\u0651\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0670\u0648\u064e\u0670\u062a\u0650 \u0648\u064e\u0671\u0644\u06e1\u0623\u064e\u0631\u06e1\u0636\u064e \u0628\u0650\u0671\u0644\u06e1\u062d\u064e\u0642\u0651\u0650\u06d6 \u064a\u064f\u0643\u064e\u0648\u0651\u0650\u0631\u064f \u0671\u0644\u0651\u064e\u064a\u06e1\u0644\u064e \u0639\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0649 \u0671\u0644\u0646\u0651\u064e\u0647\u064e\u0627\u0631\u0650 \u0648\u064e\u064a\u064f\u0643\u064e\u0648\u0651\u0650\u0631\u064f \u0671\u0644\u0646\u0651\u064e\u0647\u064e\u0627\u0631\u064e \u0639\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0649 \u0671\u0644\u0651\u064e\u064a\u06e1\u0644\u0650\u06d6 \u0648\u064e\u0633\u064e\u062e\u0651\u064e\u0631\u064e \u0671\u0644\u0634\u0651\u064e\u0645\u06e1\u0633\u064e \u0648\u064e\u0671\u0644\u06e1\u0642\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0631\u064e\u06d6 \u0643\u064f\u0644\u0651\u065e \u064a\u064e\u062c\u06e1\u0631\u0650\u064a \u0644\u0650\u0623\u064e\u062c\u064e\u0644\u0656 \u0645\u0651\u064f\u0633\u064e\u0645\u0651\u064b\u0649\u06d7 \u0623\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0627 \u0647\u064f\u0648\u064e \u0671\u0644\u06e1\u0639\u064e\u0632\u0650\u064a\u0632\u064f \u0671\u0644\u06e1\u063a\u064e\u0641\u0651\u064e\u0640\u0670\u0631\u064f\nKhalaqas samaawaati wal arda bilhaqq; yukawwirul laila \u2018alan nahaari wa yukawwirun nahaara \u2018alaal laili wa sakhkharash shamsa walqamara kulluny yajree li ajalim musammaa; alaa Huwal \u2018Azeezul Ghaffaar\nEnglish Translation:\"He created the heavens and earth in truth.

They have an inherent distrust in people, and so when their suspicion is confirmed - they are pleased. Others may find pleasure in seeing the fault in others as a way to avoid dealing with their deficiencies.\nWhat is better for the believer is to look for the good, just as Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 wants to forgive His servants. He wants those who make mistakes to rise above them, i.e., to seek His forgiveness and to be better because of it. We should give people the same opportunity. It does take being vulnerable to some extent, but that is not a weakness. Lead with love, trust, and compassion. Only once your kindness is taken advantage of should you review your terms of interaction with that particular individual. Be oft-forgiving and avoid growing bitter towards humanity at large.\nReferences:\n[1] Riyad as-Salihin 442\n[2] Sahih Muslim 2590b & Sahih (Al-Albani) Sunan Abi Dawud 4893\n\n\n",

            "mentions-from-quran-hadith": "\n\nArabic Root:From the root qaf-ha-ra (\u0642 \u0647 \u0631), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to overcome, conquer to overpower, master to dominate over, prevail to subdue, subjugate, to compel against one\u2019s wishes.\nThe names Al-Qahhar and Al-Qahir:There are two names, Al-Qahir, and Al-Qahhar. The name Al-Qahir is the base form meaning \"the irresistible.\" On the other hand, Al-Qahhar is more emphatic, the one who is all over-powering, all-prevailing. Al-Qahir is mentioned twice in the Qur'an in Surah al-An'am verse 18 and verse 61. while Al-Qahhar is used more intensively, mentioned a total of 6 times.\nThis name informs us that Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 strength is unmatched. He has absolute sovereignty over all His creation. He is the dominator. Whoever is an enemy or challenges Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 stands no chance. He can humiliate them with ease. Things are measured on the scale of eternity, so if a person opposes Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 they will lose inevitably. There isn't a single creation that isn't subjected to Allah's will or could escape it.\nThe pairing of Al-Qahhar with Al-Wahid:In the Qur'an, this name is also always coupled with the name Al-Wahid, meaning \"The One.\" A king in this world can be powerful, but it's not because he possesses intrinsic power.

In this case, the names Al-Azeez (The Exalted / The Mighty) is paired with Al-Wahhab. This signals the purity of the gift. Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 is The All Mighty, He does not need anything, so when He gives, He gives freely. There is no ulterior motive, no looking to get in someone's favor. Unlike humans, we understand there's an unspoken social contract to reciprocate the giving. If someone invites you to their wedding, you feel almost compelled or obligated to invite them to yours. Allah is greater. He just gives and gives without any limits.\nThe pairing of these two names also shows how nothing can come in the way of His giving. We live in a world where politics, leadership, and logistics all come in the way, preventing good people from helping one another. The wealthiest countries in the world still have some degree of the population suffering from poverty and hunger, and it's not because of a lack of resources. Even if they wanted to help, they could not. Allah's bounties have no limits, and no one can prevent Him from Giving to whom He wills.\nAllah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 does not need anything from His servants. We know His gifts are purely out of His generosity and kindness. They serve as a reminder of His love for all His creation. He even gives to those who might not be deserving; perhaps they would realize that their Lord is showering them with many blessings and that they return to Him. This would be a gift within a gift - He gives so you can get to know Him, leading us to seek His approval and mercy.\n\n\nProphetic supplication with this name:If you wish to call upon this beautiful name of Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 we can learn the du'a Prophet Suleiman (as) recited asking for forgivness and wealth.\n \u0642\u064e\u0627\u0644\u064e \u0631\u064e\u0628\u0651\u0650 \u0671\u063a\u06e1\u0641\u0650\u0631\u06e1 \u0644\u0650\u064a \u0648\u064e\u0647\u064e\u0628\u06e1 \u0644\u0650\u064a \u0645\u064f\u0644\u06e1\u0643\u0657\u0627 \u0644\u0651\u064e\u0627 \u064a\u064e\u0646\u06e2\u0628\u064e\u063a\u0650\u064a \u0644\u0650\u0623\u064e\u062d\u064e\u062f\u0656 \u0645\u0651\u0650\u0646\u06e2 \u0628\u064e\u0639\u06e1\u062f\u0650\u064a\u0653\u06d6 \u0625\u0650\u0646\u0651\u064e\u0643\u064e \u0623\u064e\u0646\u062a\u064e \u0671\u0644\u06e1\u0648\u064e\u0647\u0651\u064e\u0627\u0628\u064f\nQaala Rabbigh fir lee wa hab lee mulkal laa yambaghee li ahadin min ba\u2019dee innaka Antal Wahhaab\nEnglish Translation:\"He said, 'My Lord, forgive me and grant me a kingdom such as will not belong to anyone after me. Indeed, You are the Bestower.'\" \u2014 (Qur'an 38:35)\nReflection:This name should also make us realize that our success is only through Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670. Whatever good you do, who inspired that impulse within you? Who records and rewards the good one does? It's all from Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670. He is not obliged in any way, and He does whatever He wishes. But through learning about Allah's divine names, we learn about His justice, generosity, and abundance, as well as His care, love, and forgiveness. These are all gifts of Al-Wahhab.\nUpon further reflection on this name, we may also realize that any inherent skills/qualities we have are also a gift from Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670. Don't let your nafs (i.e., ego) intrude and take control over your heart. We do that in part by remaining thankful to Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 because we did nothing to be deserving of His gifts. He just gives, period. No questions asked, no \"please sign here on the dotted line.\" He then leaves us with the choice to take it for granted or to be grateful. It's on us to see His kindness and His mercy.\nNarrated Uqba: I offered the Asr prayer behind the Prophet (\ufdfa) at Medina. When he had finished the prayer with Taslim, he got up hurriedly and went out by crossing the rows of the people to one of the dwellings of his wives. The people got scared at his speed. The Prophet (\ufdfa) came back and found the people surprised at his haste and said to them, \"I remembered a piece of gold Lying in my house and I did not like it to divert my attention from Allah's worship, so I have ordered it to be distributed (in charity). [1]\nThe gift in you:Let's say you gave a gift to a friend, and you see it wasn't appreciated, used, or had the opposite effect you intended - how would you feel? The truth is it hurts. Imagine a recent kidney donor seeing their friend revert back to being an alcoholic. It would be a big slap in the face. Similarly, Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 has given certain people gifts that get abused. We have knowledgeable people, but they use their knowledge to manipulate and cheat others. In the act of omission, Allah's given us the faculty to achieve great things, but we don't live up to our potential. Instead, we get caught up and waste time playing meaningless games. We must try our best to use the gifts Allah's given us in a way that would not insult the giver. We should use our gifts to spread goodness to try and uplift and benefit others.\nJust as Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 gives gifts out of love we should learn to do the same. \"Aishah narrated: 'The Prophet would accept gifts and he would give something in return.'\" [2]\nAbu Huraira reported that the Prophet \ufdfa said, \"Give gifts and you will love one another.\" [3] And just as a reminder, no gift is too small. Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah \ufdfa said, \"O Muslim women! No one of you should consider insignificant (a gift) to give to her neighbour even if it is (a gift of) the trotters of a sheep\".

            "description": "The Provider, The Sustainer. The one who creates sustenance for all His creations.",
            "mentions-from-quran-hadith": "\nArabic Roots:From the root ra-zay-qaf (\u0631 \u0632 \u0642), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to receive something beneficial, especially as a gift to be provided with the necessities of life, to receive a portion, share or lot, to be supplied with a means of subsistence.\nThe difference between Ar-Razzaq and Al-Wahhab:There is often confusion between the names Al-Wahhab (The Bestower) and Ar-Razzaq (The Provider). Al-Wahhab contains the same root as the name Hiba, which means a gift. So, Al-Wahhab refers to Allah's attribute of being the perpetual giver of gifts. It knows no bounds and requires no action from the receiver. Now, rizq has multiple meanings; the first is of general sustenance. This refers to any physical or material wealth. It's what has been allocated by the creator for you. However, unlike a gift, effort must be applied to receive it. This encompasses the outward definition of rizq. Rizq can also apply to inward sustenance - one that benefits your soul, your heart (emotional sustenance), your faith, and your health. When you count on Allah's \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 blessings, seek the rizq that will purify your soul, guide you, and increase your imaan for it is nobler. The inward sustenance is ever-lasting, whereas material provision, although necessary, is only temporary.\nA lesson from Prophet Ibrahim (as):In the Qur'an, Surah Ash-Shu'ara, Prophet Ibrahim (as) addresses Polytheists giving reasons why Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 should be the only one worthy of worship. He argues how it is Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670, \"Who created me and Who guides me; Who gives me food and drink, and Who, when I am ill, heals me; Who will cause me to die and then will again restore me to life.\" (Qur'an 26:78-81) What's interesting to note here is the order of things mentioned. Prophet Ibrahim (as) first shows appreciation for his existence and to be among those Allah guided. He only then shifts to the outward rizq of worldly provisions such as food, drink, and health.\nThe name mentioned in the Qur'an:There are countless ayat which discuss Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 as being The Provider. For example, \"Allah is the one who created you, then provided for you, then will cause you to die, and then will give you life. Are there any of your 'partners' who does anything of that? Exalted is He and high above what they associate with Him\" (Qur'an 30:40) and also, \"O mankind, remember the favor of Allah upon you. Is there any creator other than Allah who provides for you from the heaven and earth? There is no deity except Him, so how are you deluded?\" (Qur'an 35:3) But as a reference to the name Ar-Razzaq there is only one instance:\n \u0648\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0627 \u062e\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0642\u0652\u062a\u064f \u0671\u0644\u0652\u062c\u0650\u0646\u0651\u064e \u0648\u064e\u0671\u0644\u0652\u0625\u0650\u0646\u0633\u064e \u0625\u0650\u0644\u0651\u064e\u0627 \u0644\u0650\u064a\u064e\u0639\u0652\u0628\u064f\u062f\u064f\u0648\u0646\u0650\n \u0645\u064e\u0627\u0653 \u0623\u064f\u0631\u0650\u064a\u062f\u064f \u0645\u0650\u0646\u0652\u0647\u064f\u0645 \u0645\u0651\u0650\u0646 \u0631\u0651\u0650\u0632\u0652\u0642\u064d\u06e2 \u0648\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0627\u0653 \u0623\u064f\u0631\u0650\u064a\u062f\u064f \u0623\u064e\u0646 \u064a\u064f\u0637\u0652\u0639\u0650\u0645\u064f\u0648\u0646\u0650\n \u0625\u0650\u0646\u0651\u064e \u0671\u0644\u0644\u0651\u064e\u0647\u064e \u0647\u064f\u0648\u064e \u0671\u0644\u0631\u0651\u064e\u0632\u0651\u064e\u0627\u0642\u064f \u0630\u064f\u0648 \u0671\u0644\u0652\u0642\u064f\u0648\u0651\u064e\u0629\u0650 \u0671\u0644\u0652\u0645\u064e\u062a\u0650\u064a\u0646\u064f\nWa maa khalaqtul jinna wal insa illaa liya'budoon Maaa ureedu minhum mir rizqinw wa maaa ureedu anyyut'imoon Innal laaha Huwar Razzaaqu Zul Quwwatil Mateen\nEnglish Translation:\"And I did not create the jinn and mankind except to worship Me.

Say, 'Allah. And indeed, we or you are either upon guidance or in clear error.'\" \u2014 (Qur'an 34:24)\nIs your Rizq decreed?It was Narrated Abdullah who recorded Allah's Messenger \ufdfa as saying, \"...then Allah sends an angel and orders him to write four things, i.e., his provision, his age, and whether he will be of the wretched or the blessed (in the Hereafter). Then the soul is breathed into him.\" [1]\nIf your rizq is decreed, why make du'a? This question is often asked, and it's rather a moot point. Allah's qadr (divine decree) is known only by Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670. We don't know what was written, and as mentioned previously, to receive worldly rizq still requires genuine effort. We simply don't know; it could be after reading this, you make du'a asking from Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670, and He increases what has been portioned for you.

We're afraid of losing our job, being unable to pay our bills, or not having enough to eat. We live with this constant angst and worry.\nThe release can come from knowing Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 is Ar-Razzaq. He is the best provider for all; there is not a single creature that Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 does not provide for. Since He is the only one who can give sustenance, we should seek it from Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670. Understanding this frees a person from the shackles of the influence of an unjust employer, dictator, or any kind of authority. People may be coerced to compromise their morals and resort to cheating and stealing to secure sustenance. But the one who knows Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 as Ar-Razzaq will avoid acting in this way as he knows the absolute authority is with Allah, The Almighty.\nNarrated Warrad: (the clerk of Al-Mughira bin Shu`ba) Once Al-Mughira dictated to me in a letter addressed to Muawiya that the Prophet \ufdfa used to say after every compulsory prayer, \"La ilaha illa l-lahu wahdahu la sharika lahu, lahu l-mulku wa lahu l-hamdu, wa huwa `ala kulli shay'in qadir. Allahumma la mani`a lima a`taita, wa la mu`tiya lima mana`ta, wa la yanfa`u dhal-jaddi minka l-jadd. [There is no Deity but Allah, Alone, no Partner to Him. His is the Kingdom and all praise, and Omnipotent is he. O Allah! Nobody can hold back what you gave, nobody can give what You held back, and no struggler's effort can benefit against You].\" And Al-Hasan said, \"Al-jadd' means prosperity [??].\" [2]\nThe attitude which is best for a believer to adopt was mentioned in the hadith of Sahih Muslim. Abu Hurairah narrated that the Messenger of Allah \ufdfa said: \"Look at those who are beneath you and do not look at those who are above you, for it is more suitable that you should not consider as less the blessing of Allah.\" [3] This problem has multiplied a thousandfold in the age of social media. We see the highlight reel of everyone's best life. It then leads to shaitan planting his seeds of doubt in the garden of your mind. These weeds - if not dealt with immediately - take form and spread, soon overtaking the entire garden. This manifests in a variety of ways into doubt, resentment, or belittling the favors which Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 has given us (nauzubillah). For those seeking tranquility, it is better to find contentment with that which Allah has already provided you. This sentiment is perfectly captured in Surah Ta-ha verse 131, \"And do not extend your eyes toward that by which We have given enjoyment to [some] categories of them, [its being but] the splendor of worldly life by which We test them. And the provision of your Lord is better and more enduring.\"\nIt was narrated from Salamah bin \u2018Ubaidullah bin Mihsan Al-Ansari that his father said: \"The Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) said: 'Whoever among you wakes up physically healthy, feeling safe and secure within himself, with food for the day, it is as if he acquired the whole world.'\" [4]\nReferences:\n[1] Sahih al-Bukhari 6594\n[2] Sahih al-Bukhari 844\n[3] Sahih (Darussalam) Sunan Ibn Majah 4142\n[4] Hasan (Darussalam) Sunan Ibn Majah 4141\n\n",

            "mentions-from-quran-hadith": "\nArabic Root:From the root fa-ta-ha (\u0641 \u062a \u062d), which means to open. It has the following classical Arabic connotations: to open, unlock, unfold, to make victorious, to reveal, inform, explain, make clear, to judge, to decide, to grant, and to permit.\nThe Opener:There are multiple meanings associated with this name. In Arabic, fath (\u0641\u062a\u062d) means to open, and Al-Fattah (\u0671\u0644\u0652\u0641\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0651\u0627\u062d\u064f) is The Opener. This name takes on a perpetual form that is ever-lasting. He is the one that is always doing this again and again. Now, what is implied by the opening? What is that He opens? As we covered in the last name, Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 holds the key to our sustenance (Ar-Razzaq), so naturally, He is considered the opener to provisions.\nHe is also the one who opens the door of mercy. Narrated by Abu Huraira, who reported Allah's Messenger \ufdfa as saying: When it is the month of Ramadan, the gates of mercy are opened, and the gates of Hell are locked and the devils are chained. [1]\nIt can also mean providing guidance to one who is lost, revealing the unseen, a path untrodden. Sometimes we see things as impossible. Our minds were unable to see it in a different light. But that is until Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670, in all His glory, clears our minds and opens the possibility for us. We are blinded and unable to see, i.e., until He reveals. So, we learn that Al-Fattah is the one who makes what seemed once impossible possible.\nAllah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 also opens the doors to His tests for both the believers and those who don't believe. He may open access to fame, wealth, or power just to see how we respond. For others, He may take it away. In the Qur'an, it mentions, \"So when they forgot that by which they had been reminded, We opened to them the doors of every [good] thing until, when they rejoiced in that which they were given, We seized them suddenly, and they were [then] in despair.\" (Qur'an 6:44)\nAl-Fattah in the Qur'an:Moving onto the instances of the name Al-Fattah as mentioned in the Qur'an. It appears only once; however, many verses exemplify this attribute of Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670.

Abu Hurairah narrated that the Messenger of Allah \ufdfa said: \"Indeed Allah Most High says: 'I am as My slave thinks of Me, and I am with him when He calls upon Me.'\"  [2]\nFrom this name, we further recognize that Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 is the only one we need to rely upon. Whatever it is we need access to, Al-Fattah is the one who can open it for us. If you're feeling stuck or struggling to make a decision, pray salat al-istikhara. Ask Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 to open your heart to make the right choice.

And Allah is your protector, and He is the Knowing, the Wise.\" \u2014 (Qur'an 66:2)\nYou've likely heard this quote before stating, \"knowledge is power.\" But your experience or intuition may recognize that this saying is incomplete. Simply just getting more information does not directly correlate with having power. You probably know many intellectual people, but they are still prone to making very wrong decisions. They can be led astray by emotions and desires. They may have biases causing them to be blinded or tunnel-visioned. Would you call this person wise? Probably not. The issue with the quote is that it grossly downplays the importance of applying knowledge. This is what most recognize as wisdom.\nIt's not enough to read a book. A wise person would reflect upon what's being read and try to map all the ways it's applicable in his or her everyday life. A wise person, just like a knowledgeable one, knows what to say but, more importantly, when to say it. That makes all the difference. Similarly, Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 is the All-Knowing and the All-Wise. He knows what to do, when to do them, and with whom.\nTwo lessons from knowing the pair Al-Hakeem and Al-Aleem:1. Understanding how Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 is both knowing and wise can bring peace into the believer's life. We put complete trust in Allah's plan for us and what He's decreed, as we know He makes no mistakes. When calamity strikes, if we don't get that job, if we lose something we treasure - we trust that Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 knows best. There is no point in dwelling and feeling sorry for past hardships. Often the greatest pain we experience becomes our biggest strength with time and understanding. Even if we can't see the wisdom in it in this life, we must realize the benefit must lie on the day of judgment. This is the mercy of Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.2. We should ask Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 to give us wisdom. People often give too much weight trying to find the \"secret.\" The one thing that'll transform their life for the better. It doesn't exist, and the people purchasing the courses, books, or instructors that make these promises are taken advantage of. This is not meant to discourage seeking knowledgeable instructors or keep one from purchasing books or courses. But really it's in Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 what we should be seeking. If we don't have the intelligence or wisdom to apply our knowledge, to have the courage to take bold action when needed or to be resourceful, then it would all be for nothing.\nReflection:As a person grows older, he begins to learn about different subjects and thinks of himself as knowledgeable. But if we stop to think of the vastness of Allah's knowledge, we realize we know nothing. It's a humbling experience to really ponder and ask ourselves how much we think we know. Realize and embrace the truth that we know nothing in the grand scheme of things. Letting any amount of superiority sink its way into your mind will just impede the way to further growth. A child learns the most because they are naturally curious. Everything is new and an exciting adventure. They are open, innocent and genuinely want to understand how everything works. This spurs a parent's favorite game with a child called a hundred thousand why's (sarcasm). But if you assume you already know, then the journey stops. Why explore something further if you feel you already know the outcome?\nKnowledge is given by Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 tells us in Surah Baqarah, \"And [mention, O Muhammad], when your Lord said to the angels, 'Indeed, I will make upon the earth a successive authority.' They said, 'Will You place upon it one who causes corruption therein and sheds blood, while we declare Your praise and sanctify You?' Allah said, 'Indeed, I know that which you do not know.' And He taught Adam the names \u2013 all of them. Then He showed them to the angels and said, 'Inform Me of the names of these, if you are truthful.'\" (Qur'an 2:30-31) The angels then responded with the following:\n \u0642\u064e\u0627\u0644\u064f\u0648\u0627\u0652  \u0633\u064f\u0628\u06e1\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0643\u064e  \u0644\u064e\u0627  \u0639\u0650\u0644\u06e1\u0645\u064e  \u0644\u064e\u0646\u064e\u0627\u0653  \u0625\u0650\u0644\u0651\u064e\u0627  \u0645\u064e\u0627  \u0639\u064e\u0644\u0651\u064e\u0645\u06e1\u062a\u064e\u0646\u064e\u0627\u0653\u06d6  \u0625\u0650\u0646\u0651\u064e\u0643\u064e  \u0623\u064e\u0646\u062a\u064e  \u0671\u0644\u06e1\u0639\u064e\u0644\u0650\u064a\u0645\u064f  \u0671\u0644\u06e1\u062d\u064e\u0643\u0650\u064a\u0645\u064f\nQaaloo subhaanaka laa ilma lanaaa illaa maa allamtanaaa innaka antal aleemul hakeem\nEnglish Translation:\"They said, 'Exalted are You; we have no knowledge except what You have taught us. Indeed, it is You who is the Knowing, the Wise.'\" \u2014 (Qur'an 2:32)\nThese verses are a testament to how all creations have their limitations set by Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670, and without His permission, they could not know anything beyond what was allowed for them. Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 tell us He, \"taught Adam the names \u2013 all of them.\" What is meant by names is left up to interpretation. Ibn Abbas understood it as names of objects for everyday discourse. Other commentators believe it to be the spoken languages on earth, or the capacity to know all things, or it could refer to Allah's Divine Names. Regardless, we see the separation between Angels' knowledge, which is limited compared to human knowledge, designed to be more comprehensive. In the tafheem ul-Quran, Maududi remarks, \"It seems that the knowledge of each angel and each genre of angel is confined to its own sphere of competence. The angels appointed to administer, let us say, things relating to air have full knowledge about this subject but have no knowledge, say, about water, and so on and so forth. Man's range of knowledge, however, is comprehensive.\"\nWe don't know what we don't know \u2013 we may ask for forgiveness for things in our hearts we know we did wrong. But what about the things we are not aware of? Ask Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 to pardon all our sins, to give us a clean slate. Ask to increase our capacity to learn and to know of our shortcomings, to make us among students with great Islamic knowledge. We are blessed today to study His attributes. This is one of the most beneficial paths one can take. It will only increase a person's love for their creator and be among those who've acquired knowledge that will benefit them. Insha-Allah, this will also lead us to share this knowledge with others and help guide others toward the straight path. Narrated Zayd ibn Thabit: I heard the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) say: May Allah brighten a man who hears a tradition from us, gets it by heart and passes it on to others. Many a bearer of knowledge conveys it to one who is more versed than he is; and many a bearer of knowledge is not versed in it. [1]\nIt was narrated that Zirr bin Hubaish said: \"I went to Safwan bin Assal Al-Muradi and he said: What brought you here? I said: I am seeking knowledge. He said: I heard the Messenger of Allah say: \"There is no one who goes out of his house in order to seek knowledge, but the angels lower their wings in approval of his action.\" [2]\nReferences:\n[1] Sahih (Al-Albani) Sunan Abi Dawud 3660\n[2] Hasan (Darussalam) Sunan Ibn Majah 226\n\n\n",

But He sends [it] down in an amount which He wills. Indeed He is, of His servants, Acquainted and Seeing.\" (Qur'an 42:27)\nIt is difficult, but if we go through a period of constriction, we should find peace as Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 knows best. We can always uncover some good in the bad. We are brought down to earth, and we are humbled. By switching our narrative, we can help transform a tragedy into an opportunity. If we see this period of our life as a test, we can behave in a manner that Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 would love to see His servant respond. For example, strive harder in worship, show sabr (patience), seek to do good deeds, help others, and take care of yourself. Perhaps these tough times are necessary to create future leaders who are more resilient, grounded, empathetic, and wise.

He is the master. He can constrict whatever He wills for whomever, howsoever. All of creation exists because of Him, and it's under His control. He can dispose of His dominion however He wishes. It is not up to us to judge whether a thing is good or bad. Whatever Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 wills is good since it's from Him. He's not limited in what He can do \u2014 this goes back to the attributes of power, control, and supreme authority.\nThe divine pairing with Al-Qabid:As we discussed previously, the perfection in meaning is best understood through viewing the names in pairs as they occur.

These names include Al-Qabid (The Constrictor) & Al-Basit (The Extender), Al-Awwal (The Very First from Eternity) & Al-Akhir (The very Last for Eternity), and Az-Zaahir (The Perceptible) & Al-Baatin (The Imperceptible), Al-Mu'izz (The Honourer-Bestower) & Al-Mudhill (The Abaser).\n\n\nIn Arabic qabd means to clench, to grasp, or to seize whereas bast refers to openness. Think closed hand versus open hand, to withhold and to give. Allah will say, 'Go and take out (of Hell) anyone in whose heart you find faith equal to the weight of one (gold) Dinar.' Allah will forbid the Fire to burn the faces of those sinners. They will go to them and find some of them in Hell (Fire) up to their feet, and some up to the middle of their legs. So they will take out those whom they will recognize and then they will return, and Allah will say (to them), 'Go and take out (of Hell) anyone in whose heart you find faith equal to the weight of one half Dinar.' They will take out whomever they will recognize and return, and then Allah will say, 'Go and take out (of Hell) anyone in whose heart you find faith equal to the weight of an atom (or a smallest ant), and so they will take out all those whom they will recognize.\" Abu Sa'id said: If you do not believe me then read the Holy Verse: 'Surely! Allah wrongs not even of the weight of an atom (or a smallest ant) but if there is any good (done) He doubles it.' (Qur'an 4:40) The Prophet added, \"Then the prophets and Angels and the believers will intercede, and (last of all) the Almighty (Allah) will say, 'Now remains My Intercession. He will then hold a handful (the word used here \u0642\u064e\u0628\u0652\u0636\u064e\u0629\u064b - qabdatan meaning hold, grip, grab) of the Fire from which He will take out some people whose bodies have been burnt, and they will be thrown into a river at the entrance of Paradise, called the water of life.

What was his fate despite having immense power and being the Pharaoh of Egypt? As the story goes, He sought after Musa (as) to kill or imprison him, and Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 protects Musa (as) by granting him entry through the sea by parting it. \"Then We inspired to Moses, \"Strike with your staff the sea,\" and it parted, and each portion was like a great towering mountain.\" (Surah Ash-Shu'ara Ayat 63) Firaun was a witness to this but still decided to pursue and capture Musa (as) and the Israelites to prevent their escape. But the Qur'an mentions, \"Then We drowned the others.\" (Surah Ash-Shu'ara Ayat 66)\nNow, the Qur'an does not explicitly state Firaun's name but focuses on Musa's story (as) instead. Still, the best historical account of the Pharaoh during Prophet Musa (as) time is guessed to be King Ramses II. King Ramses Mummy has been preserved and is now open to the public for visitation in the Cairo Museum in Egypt. The Qur'an says about Firaun, \"So today We will save you in body that you may be to those who succeed you a sign. And indeed, many among the people, of Our signs, are heedless\" (Qur'an 10:92)\n\n\nReflection:The idea of Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 being the reducer can be studied indirectly through referencing other verses from the Qur'an, which emphasize the quality.

But when He tries him and restricts his provision, he says, 'My Lord has humiliated me.' \u2014 (Quran 89:15-16)\nThe Tafheem ul-Qur'an by Abul-Maududi explores an interesting perspective on the last ayah. If the believer's reaction when his or her financial situation worsens is, \"My Lord has humiliated me,\" reveals a hidden message or wrongful thinking the person may have been blinded to. In this case, the person may be afraid to be seen as a failure. Their ego was preoccupied with attaining worldly success (which is not inherently problematic), but they may have identified with it too deeply. They fail to realize that having wealth is not a sign of Allah's approval and that a lack is not a sign of His displeasure. Rather both are tests for the believer. In wealth, the test is whether or not the person will forget his Lord or become arrogant and ingrateful. Or, as we've mentioned previously, in a position of power, will they become abusive, corrupt, and try to take advantage of people for personal gain?\nIn poverty, the test is different. It may be a test of patience, to find satisfaction or contentment in scarcity, or whether the person can remain grateful to Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 for that which they still have. Or will his faith decrease, and his displeasure with Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 increase? Will they transgress Allah's commandments and become immoral to change their current circumstance?\nWe've mentioned this hadith in one of the other names of Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670, but it is worth reiterating here for this name. It was narrated from Salamah bin Ubaidullah bin Mihsan Al-Ansari that his father said: The Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) said: 'Whoever among you wakes up physically healthy, feeling safe and secure within himself with food for the day, it is as if he acquired the whole world.'

It is yet another example of how if Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 chooses, He can either exalt or debase. The popular belief among scholars is that Iblees was not an Angel but among the Jinns. But he was a high-ranking and pious one devoted to Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670.\nThe reasoning for him being among the Jinn is that \"..angels stern (and) severe, who flinch not (from executing) the Commands they receive from Allah, but do (precisely) what they are commanded.\" (Qur'an 66:6). Angels have no free will and carry out the commandments of Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670, there is no disobedience. We're also told by Aishah (May Allah be pleased with her) that  The Messenger of Allah \ufdfa said, \"Angels were created from light, jinns were created from a smokeless flame of fire, and 'Adam was created from that which you have been told (i.e., sounding clay like the clay of pottery).\" [1]\nThe confusion as to whether Iblees was an Angel comes from this verse, \"And [mention] when We said to the angels, 'Prostrate before Adam'; so they prostrated, except for Iblees. He refused and was arrogant and became of the disbelievers.\" (Qur'an 2:34) The exclusion 'except Iblees' seems to imply He was among the Angels. Al-Qurtubi said in his tafsir of Surah Baqarah: \"The idea that he was one of the angels is the view of the majority [i.e., of the early sahaba], Ibn Abbas, Ibn Mas'ud, Ibn Jurayj, Ibn al-Musayyib, Qutadah and others.\" But in Surah Kahf, it is made clear, \"And [mention] when We said to the angels, 'Prostrate to Adam,' and they prostrated, except for Iblees. He was of the jinn and departed from the command of his Lord.\" (Qur'an 18:50) Still the view among some is he was an Angel and then became of the Jinn upon his refusal. He was given the privilege to be the only one among the Angels when Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 revealed to them His latest creation in Adam (as). But in Surah Sad, when Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 asked why he refused to prostrate to Adam, \"He said, 'I am better than him. You created me from fire and created him from clay.'\" (Qur'an 38:76).\nFrom these verses and the hadith, it seems clear the popular opinion should be that Iblees was a high-ranking Jinn who became debased. \"[Allah] said, 'Get out of here; surely you are rajim accursed, And indeed, upon you is My curse until the Day of Recompense.'\" (Qur'an 38:77-78)\nAllah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 raised the rank of Muhammad \ufdfa: In Surah Ash-Sharh verse 4, Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 reminds Prophet Muhammad \ufdfa He had raised his status to comfort him. Remember that this was an early Meccan surah when the Prophet was relatively unknown, with a few followers.\n \u0648\u064e\u0631\u064e\u0641\u064e\u0639\u0652\u0646\u064e\u0627 \u0644\u064e\u0643\u064e \u0630\u0650\u0643\u0652\u0631\u064e\u0643\u064e\nWa raf ana laka zikrak\nEnglish Translation:\"And raised high for you your repute.\" \u2014 (Qur'an 95:4)\nReflection:The believer benefits from the knowledge of this name. It re-affirms the reality that Ar-Rafi is the one we should rely upon. Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 is high above all, so whatever it is you wish to be increased in, call upon this name. Only Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 can increase your ranks; there is no other.\nBe detached from your wrong-doings. Your wrong-doings are not you. Similarly, avoid the goal seeking to be raised because it creates a trap for yourself. What happens if you don't feel your status being elevated? Do you lose hope and motivation and stop seeking it from Allah? Imam Zarruq writes, \"Whosoever comes to understand that He is Al-Khafid Ar-Rafi does not place his trust in any of his states, and he settles with no reliance on any component of his knowledge or any action of his. Besides, he desires neither a lowering nor an uplifting, since the two of them are not gained saved through Him.\" The one who worships Allah because they understand only He is worthy of worship, regardless of their emotional state or in success or poverty.\nImam al-Ghazali writes regarding his counsel for this name, \"Man's share in this consists in exalting the truth and abasing falsehood, by supporting those who are right and reporaching those who are wrong, treating God's enemies as enemies in order to abase them and befriending God's friends in order to exalt them.\"\nReferences:\n[1] Sahih Muslim 2996 & Riyad as-Salihin 1846\n\n\n",

            "mentions-from-quran-hadith": "\n\nArabic Root:From the root ayn-zay-zay (\u0639 \u0632 \u0632), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to be mighty, potent, strong, powerful, high, elevated, noble, exalted, honorable, to be noble, glorious, illustrious, indomitable, invincible, respected, cherished, dear to, scarce, rare, precious, and/or unattainable.\nThe following two names in the series (i.e., Al-Mu'izz and Al-Mudhill) are closely related to the previous names. The emphasis of these attributes is on giving dominion or sovereignty to the people and/or taking it away. Imam al-Ghazali writes on Al-Mu'izz, \"true dominion consists in deliverance [meaning set free] from the shame of need, the dominance of passion, and the disgrace of ignorance.\"\nAmong the disputed names:We've also covered how varying scholars have different criteria for what consitutes as a name of Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670. Al-Mu'izz is not fully recognized as an official name by certain scholars such as Ibn Uthaymeen, Ibn Hazm, and Ibn al-Wazir among others. As a rule of thumb, if the name contains prefix alif lam before the name then that's a clear indication of belonging as a name of Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670.\nThe name Al-Mu'izz does not appear in the Qur'an, but many verses allude to this attribute as the one who gives izzah meaning strength, power, or dignity.

There is no deficiency in His perception. He hears all, even if it were hidden. He knows what is felt by the heart. So, whatever it is you want, make du'a and ask of it from Allah the Almighty. There is no limit and nothing He can't fulfill. This attribute is also a reminder if you need someone to talk to, He will always be there to hear from His servant. We don't have to go to His house (Kaabah) just to be close to Him. \"And when My servants ask you, [O Muhammad], concerning Me \u2013 indeed I am near. I respond to the invocation of the supplicant when he calls upon Me\" (Qur'an 2:186)\nHuman desire to be heard:All humans, on some level, crave to be loved and heard. And sometimes, the people closest to us can hurt us the most because we expect them to reciprocate interest, and when they don't, it feels like a betrayal. We've taken time to listen to them, but they turn around and prioritize their own lives, issues, and problems. It can feel isolating. We should recognize a good friend is someone who will listen not just when we've got good news but when we're down.

And Allah hears your dialogue; indeed, Allah is Hearing and Seeing.\" \u2014 (Qur'an 58:1)\nThis ayah also shows a second meaning to the name Sami which is 'hearing the speech' or acceptance. For example, when a person praying comes up from ruku they say, \u0633\u064e\u0645\u0650\u0639\u064e \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0651\u064e\u0647\u064f \u0644\u0650\u0645\u064e\u0646\u0652 \u062d\u064e\u0645\u0650\u062f\u064e\u0647\u064f Sami Allahu liman hamidah, meaning 'Allah hears the one who praises Him.' [1]\n\n\nFrom the Story of Prophet Yaqub (as):At some low point in our lives, we may have questioned whether Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 has heard our prayers. In a moment of weakness, the shaitan whispers in our ears, tricking us into thinking our supplication went \"unheard.\" This is faulty thinking. Just because we immediately didn't get what we wanted doesn't mean He hasn't heard our prayer. Remember that even Prophet Yaqub (as) spent many years separated from his son Yusuf (as). He grieved as any father would. The Qur'an states Yaqub's (as) vision became impaired from stress, sorrow, and frequent sobbing. But Yaqub (as) never wavered in Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 plan for him. He kept turning to Him, praying, making du'a, asking that he be reunited with his son. He would say, \"I only complain of my suffering and my grief to Allah\u2026\" (Qur'an 12:86) and \"And Allah has full power and control over His Affairs, but most of men know not.\" (Qur'an 12:21) Eventually, His du'a went from being heard to accepted and he was reunited with his son.\nThe other subtlety that's often missed, which encompasses the name Al-Sami, is Allah's acceptance and/or His response. As Yaqub (as) mentioned, \"Allah has full power and control over His affairs.\" This is why Prophet Ibrahim and Ishamel (may peace be upon them) asked Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 to accept their du'a as He is Samme'ul Aleem.

Indeed You are the Hearing, the Knowing.\" \u2014 (Qur'an 2:127)\nReflection:Learning about As-Sami is a reminder to ourselves to become better listeners. Just as Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 tells us He listens, can we say the same? How closely have we heard and understood the calling of Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670? Could we do better in following what was shown to us for guidance? Go out and seek to hear things that will benefit the mind, body, and soul. Listen and learn from the Qur'an, and seek knowledge that benefits your life, career, marriage, children, and your deen. Set aside a portion of your day, be it 10-20 minutes, to search for these things.\nFrom this, we also understand the importance of being watchful over our words and our actions. If in every moment we realized Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 was watching over us, then we would speak and act in the highest manner. We would be diligent to avoid all that which displeases Him.\nFurthermore, it makes us reflect on the importance that good communication plays in our lives. How would you assess or grade your listening skills? It truly is an art form to be mastered. A mother who is upset with her son may not really be upset about the subject matter. If it's a common occurrence, it may be seeking attention in the only way she knows the son will respond. Good communication is picking up on or asking ourselves if we're missing something other than what's being said. This goes back to human desire to be heard and understood.\nIn the hadith narrated by Abu Musa: We were with the Prophet (\ufdfa) on a journey, and whenever we ascended a high place, we used to say, \"Allahu Akbar.\" The Prophet (\ufdfa) said, \"Don't trouble yourselves too much! You are not calling a deaf or an absent person, but you are calling One Who Hears, Sees, and is very near.\" [2]\nFind comfort in knowing we are never truly alone, \"you are calling One Who Hears, Sees, and is very near.\" The world may misunderstand you, but Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 knows the purity and kindness that lives in your heart. He understands what's really being said and what we need.\nReferences:\n[1] Sahih (Darussalam) Sunan an-Nasa'i 1062\n[2] Sahih al-Bukhari 7386\n\n\n",

Imagine being in Prophet Musa (as) shoes. You know Firaun's violent history of torturing and enslaving anyone who defied him. Now, imagine Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 telling you He is by your side.

Although it can be difficult to find in your heart to forgive a perpetrator, personal retribution is not always necessary, knowing justice will be served on the day of judgment. This is not meant with any malice. Perhaps whatever the person did, he atoned sincerely, and Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 sees and knows best. But from an individual standpoint, if we understand and accept Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 is Al-Hakam, it can be used as a tool to remain emotionally whole and to find forgiveness instead of seeking revenge.\nWe share a beautiful quote by the writer Cormac McCarthy on forgiveness, \"He knew that our enemies by contrast seem always with us. The greater our hatred the more persistent the memory of them so that a truly terrible enemy becomes deathless. So that the man who has done you great injury or injustice makes himself a guest in your house forever. Perhaps only forgiveness can dislodge him.\" This is similar to the idea that hate is a poison more deadly to the hater than the hated.\n \u0648\u064e\u0671\u062a\u0651\u064e\u0628\u0650\u0639\u0652 \u0645\u064e\u0627 \u064a\u064f\u0648\u062d\u064e\u0649\u0670\u0653 \u0625\u0650\u0644\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0643\u064e \u0648\u064e\u0671\u0635\u0652\u0628\u0650\u0631\u0652 \u062d\u064e\u062a\u0651\u064e\u0649\u0670 \u064a\u064e\u062d\u0652\u0643\u064f\u0645\u064e \u0671\u0644\u0644\u0651\u064e\u0647\u064f \u06da \u0648\u064e\u0647\u064f\u0648\u064e \u062e\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0631\u064f \u0671\u0644\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0640\u0670\u0643\u0650\u0645\u0650\u064a\u0646\u064e\nWattabi maa yoohaaa ilaika wasbir hattaa yahkumal laah; wa Huwa khairul haakimeen (section 11)\nEnglish Translation:\"And follow what is revealed to you, [O Muhammad], and be patient until Allah will judge.

To make equal, uniform, to turn one away from something, rightly, direct, to make comfortable with what is right.\nAmong the disputed names: We've mentioned previously how varying scholars have different criteria for what constitutes being a name of Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670. The name Al-Adl is not recognized as an official name by scholars such as Ibn Uthaymeen, Ibn Hazm, and Ibn al-Wazir, among others.

It is more comprehensive seeing all His attributes working together, including Him being the All-Knower, the All-Wise, The Merciful, and The Embodiment of Justice.\nAllah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 tells mankind, \"Surely We will test you with a bit of fear and hunger, and loss in wealth and lives and fruits, and give good tidings to the patient.\" ( Qur'an 2:155) And Prophet Muhammad \ufdfa said,  \"No fatigue, nor disease, nor sorrow, nor sadness, nor hurt, nor distress befalls a Muslim, even if it were the prick he receives from a thorn, but that Allah expiates some of his sins for that.\"  [2] So, we must remember this life is only temporary, and with \"every hardship is ease,\" whether it is realized in this life or the hereafter. This is Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 justice - it will always be fair and measured. \"Allah does not task any self beyond its capacity\" (Qur'an 2:286).\nOn the suffering of a child:For every child that passes away, they are granted eternal bliss in Paradise. In a hadith, it reports Allah's Messenger (\ufdfa) who used to ask his companions, \"Did anyone of you see a dream?\" and they told him their dream. He commented on this dream, \" And the tall man whom you saw in the garden, is Abraham and the children around him are those children who die with Al-Fitra (the Islamic Faith). Some Muslims asked the Prophet, \"O Allah's Messenger (\ufdfa)! What about the children of pagans?\" The Prophet (\ufdfa) replied, \"And also the children of pagans.\"\"  [3]\nAbu Hassan reported: I said to Abu Huraira that my two children had died. Would you narrate to me anything from Allah's Messenger (\ufdfa) a hadith that would soothe our hearts in our bereavements? He said: Yes. Small children are the fowls of Paradise. If one of them meets his father (or he said his parents) he would take hold of his cloth, or he said with his hand as I take hold of the hem of your cloth (with my hand). And he (the child) would not take off (his hand) from it until Allah causes his father to enter Paradise.[4]\nAbdullah ibn Amr reported: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said, \"Verily, those who were just will be in the presence of Allah upon pulpits of light, near the right hand of the Merciful, the Exalted, and both of His sides are honorable. They are those who practiced justice in their judgments and with their families and in all that they did.\"  [5]\n \u06de\u064a\u064e\u0640\u0670\u0653\u0623\u064e\u064a\u064f\u0651\u0647\u064e\u0627 \u0671\u0644\u064e\u0651\u0630\u0650\u064a\u0646\u064e \u0621\u064e\u0627\u0645\u064e\u0646\u064f\u0648\u0627\u0652 \u0643\u064f\u0648\u0646\u064f\u0648\u0627\u0652 \u0642\u064e\u0648\u064e\u0651\u0640\u0670\u0645\u0650\u064a\u0646\u064e \u0628\u0650\u0671\u0644\u06e1\u0642\u0650\u0633\u06e1\u0637\u0650 \u0634\u064f\u0647\u064e\u062f\u064e\u0622\u0621\u064e \u0644\u0650\u0644\u064e\u0651\u0647\u0650 \u0648\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0648\u06e1 \u0639\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670\u0653 \u0623\u064e\u0646\u0641\u064f\u0633\u0650\u0643\u064f\u0645\u06e1 \u0623\u064e\u0648\u0650 \u0671\u0644\u06e1\u0648\u064e\u0670\u0644\u0650\u062f\u064e\u064a\u06e1\u0646\u0650 \u0648\u064e\u0671\u0644\u06e1\u0623\u064e\u0642\u06e1\u0631\u064e\u0628\u0650\u064a\u0646\u064e\u06da \u0625\u0650\u0646 \u064a\u064e\u0643\u064f\u0646\u06e1 \u063a\u064e\u0646\u0650\u064a\u064b\u0651\u0627 \u0623\u064e\u0648\u06e1 \u0641\u064e\u0642\u0650\u064a\u0631\u0657\u0627 \u0641\u064e\u0671\u0644\u0644\u064e\u0651\u0647\u064f \u0623\u064e\u0648\u06e1\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 \u0628\u0650\u0647\u0650\u0645\u064e\u0627\u06d6 \u0641\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0627 \u062a\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0651\u0628\u0650\u0639\u064f\u0648\u0627\u0652 \u0671\u0644\u06e1\u0647\u064e\u0648\u064e\u0649\u0670\u0653 \u0623\u064e\u0646 \u062a\u064e\u0639\u06e1\u062f\u0650\u0644\u064f\u0648\u0627\u0652\u06da \u0648\u064e\u0625\u0650\u0646 \u062a\u064e\u0644\u06e1\u0648\u064f\u06e5\u0653\u0627\u0652 \u0623\u064e\u0648\u06e1 \u062a\u064f\u0639\u06e1\u0631\u0650\u0636\u064f\u0648\u0627\u0652 \u0641\u064e\u0625\u0650\u0646\u064e\u0651 \u0671\u0644\u0644\u064e\u0651\u0647\u064e \u0643\u064e\u0627\u0646\u064e \u0628\u0650\u0645\u064e\u0627 \u062a\u064e\u0639\u06e1\u0645\u064e\u0644\u064f\u0648\u0646\u064e \u062e\u064e\u0628\u0650\u064a\u0631\u0657\u0627\nYaa aiyuhal lazeena aamanoo koonoo qawwa ameena bilqisti shuhadaaa\u2019a lillaahi wa law \u2018alaa anfusikum awil waalidaini wal aqrabeen iny yakun ghaniyyan aw faqeeran fallaahu awlaa bihimaa falaaa tattabi\u2019ul hawaaa an ta\u2019diloo; wa in talwooo aw tu\u2019ridoo fa innal laaha kaana bimaa ta\u2019maloona Khabeera\nEnglish Translation: \"O you who have believed, be persistently standing firm in justice, witnesses for Allah, even if it be against yourselves or parents and relatives.

            "mentions-from-quran-hadith": "\n\nArabic Root:From the root lam-ta-fa (\u0644 \u0637 \u0641), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to be thin, delicate, refined, elegant, graceful, gentle, gracious, courteous, kindly, subtle, to know the obscurities of all affairs, to treat with regard for circumstances, to be most soothing and refined in manner, to treat with kindness, goodness, gentleness, benevolence, and affection.\nAll the names of Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 are beautiful and complete. But Al-Lateef often holds a special place in a believer's heart as it resonates deeply with the human spirit. It carries with it many meanings depending on the context it is used. But generally, this name refers to the attribute of \"gentleness.\" \nImam al-Ghazali writes of Al-Lateef as being the only one \"deserving of this name if one knows the subtleties of those things which are beneficial, as well as their hidden aspects, along with what is subtle about them and what is benevolent.\" Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 knows where the most subtle and hidden benefit lies, and He knows how to use it for whomever He has destined it for. This gentleness and subtlety manifest themselves in many ways. For example, attending a khutbah, watching a random video online, or reading a book a friend recommended, Al-Latef delivers a message that gives you exactly what you need to hear. It would appear like that message was directly written or spoken for you. The timing could not have been any better. Al-Ghazali continues, \"Moreover, in conveying them to those who are deserving, he is committed to the path of gentleness rather than harshness.\" \nThe knower of subtleties: Just as Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 is subtle in His kindness and giving, He is aware of all nuances or things trying to remain inconspicuous.

And he said, \"O my father, this is the explanation of my vision of before. My Lord has made it reality. And He was certainly good to me when He took me out of prison and brought you [here] from bedouin life after Satan had induced [estrangement] between me and my brothers. Indeed, my Lord is Subtle in what He wills. Indeed, it is He who is the Knowing, the Wise.\" \u2014 ( Qur'an 12:100)\n\n\nIn the story of Yusuf (as), we know he has a vision in his dream where \"eleven stars and the sun and the moon; I saw them prostrating to me.\" (Qur'an 12:4). He does not know exactly when, where, and how this will happen. But Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 had decreed this and shown him his destiny in a dream. The path was unclear and unknown to Yusuf (as). In fact, from the outside looking in, it would seem like a delusional vision as nothing seemed to go right for Yusuf (as). In his home, his older brothers were envious of Yusuf (as) and plotted to kill him, but before this plan was put into action, someone spoke up and said, \"Do not kill Joseph [Yusuf] but throw him into the bottom of the well\" (Qur'an 12:10)\nOnce abandoned in a well, a caravan passing by finds him detains him, and pawns him as a slave to the highest bidder. Another stroke of 'luck' is out of all the people, Yusuf (as) was purchased by a man named Azeez - a pious, wealthy, and respectful man. Finally, Yusuf (as) could breathe and had a place to mature, but the coast was not clear. Eventually, problems between Yusuf (as) and Zulaikha (Azeez's wife) transpired. It wasn't before long this situation led to Yusuf (as) being falsely imprisoned. In jail, he developed a reputation as being the interpreter for dreams. The security guard picks up on this talent and shares this information with the King, who is troubled by a recurring dream. This access and opportunity then granted Yusuf (as) to be recognized, released, and promoted by the King. This leads to the inevitable conclusion of the story, where Yusuf sees the dream he had as a kid come true. As this verse above states, \"this is the explanation of my vision of before. My Lord has made it reality.\" \nReflection:From the story of Prophet Yusuf (as), we can see how Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 is Al-Lateef and guides us without our knowledge. It is subtle in ways we cannot connect the dots moving forward, only looking back. Even then, we may not understand all of its intricacies. A wrong turn can lead to a disastrous outcome. Imagine the person who did not inspire the brothers to throw Yusuf (as) in the well. What if he was sold as a slave to someone other than Azeez? Would Yusuf (as) have met the King without being falsely imprisoned? We can learn from this story just how the quality of Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 being Al-Lateef manifests. Perhaps there's a blessing in not being accepted into that prestigious university you wanted. Instead, you being forced to \"settle\" for a local college, you meet a professor by \"happenstance\" who inspires you in a way no other could have. Perhaps you meet your spouse, make life-long friends, or land an internship giving you exposure to a new field you otherwise would've never explored. In not attending that prestigious university you wanted, you may have dodged some tragedy or difficulty. Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 may have protected you from being led astray. Nothing which happens in your life is good or bad as you may perceive it. Only Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 who is Al-Aleem (Knower) of all things, knows what's best. All we can do is move forward, trying to connect the dots looking back - but even then, our story is still being written, and we don't know how this story ends.\nIn a hadith narration, Prophet Muhammad \ufdfa says to Aisha (ra): \"show gentleness, for if gentleness is found in anything, it beautifies it and when it is taken out from anything it damages it.\"  [1] and in Sahih Muslim,  \"A'isha, verily Allah is kind and He loves kindness and confers upon kindness which he does not confer upon severity and does not confer upon anything else besides it (kindness).\"  [2]\nHere are the remaining four verses that metion Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 as Al-Lateef in the Qur'an:\n \u0644\u064e\u0651\u0627 \u062a\u064f\u062f\u0652\u0631\u0650\u0643\u064f\u0647\u064f \u0671\u0644\u0652\u0623\u064e\u0628\u0652\u0635\u064e\u0640\u0670\u0631\u064f \u0648\u064e\u0647\u064f\u0648\u064e \u064a\u064f\u062f\u0652\u0631\u0650\u0643\u064f \u0671\u0644\u0652\u0623\u064e\u0628\u0652\u0635\u064e\u0640\u0670\u0631\u064e \u06d6 \u0648\u064e\u0647\u064f\u0648\u064e \u0671\u0644\u0644\u064e\u0651\u0637\u0650\u064a\u0641\u064f \u0671\u0644\u0652\u062e\u064e\u0628\u0650\u064a\u0631\u064f\nLaa tudrikuhul absaaru wa Huwa yudrikul absaara wa huwal Lateeful Khabeer\nEnglish Translation: \"Vision perceives Him not, but He perceives [all] vision; and He is the Subtle, the Acquainted.\" \u2014 (Qur'an 6:103)\n \u0648\u064e\u0671\u0630\u0652\u0643\u064f\u0631\u0652\u0646\u064e \u0645\u064e\u0627 \u064a\u064f\u062a\u0652\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 \u0641\u0650\u0649 \u0628\u064f\u064a\u064f\u0648\u062a\u0650\u0643\u064f\u0646\u064e\u0651 \u0645\u0650\u0646\u0652 \u0621\u064e\u0627\u064a\u064e\u0640\u0670\u062a\u0650 \u0671\u0644\u0644\u064e\u0651\u0647\u0650 \u0648\u064e\u0671\u0644\u0652\u062d\u0650\u0643\u0652\u0645\u064e\u0629\u0650 \u06da \u0625\u0650\u0646\u064e\u0651 \u0671\u0644\u0644\u064e\u0651\u0647\u064e \u0643\u064e\u0627\u0646\u064e \u0644\u064e\u0637\u0650\u064a\u0641\u064b\u0627 \u062e\u064e\u0628\u0650\u064a\u0631\u064b\u0627\nWazkurna maa yutlaa fee bu yootikunna min aayaatil laahi wal Hikmah; innal laaha kaana lateefan Khabeera (section 4)\nEnglish Translation: \"And remember what is recited in your houses of the verses of Allah and wisdom.

This is what is meant by the perfection of attributes. He possesses these qualities intrinsically, and they are His essence. He was Al-Khaliq before the first creation was made. He was Ar-Raheem (The Merciful) before the creation of Adam (as). This is why scholars have mentioned that all of Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 actions are derived from His most glorious and perfect names.\nFor us, our names are derived from our actions. We have to prove and qualify ourselves to be called honest, trustworthy, or strong. Someone says I am strong, and we say, okay, pick this heavy thing up. We could infer from their muscles that they are strong, but that's only due to the weight training they had to do first. Whereas the qualities and attributes of Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 just are and always have been. They are eternal and part of His being. The actions which come forth are an effect of having these names.\nReflection:This name spurs the need to examine oneself or, as Shaykh Tosun Bayrak puts it, \"to be one's own doctor.\" Just as Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 is all-acquainted, we must ask ourselves if we are aware of what goes in ourselves. If we view the mind as some sort of factory, whatever you think about or consume (i.e., through the media, online videos, education, reading, friendships, etc.), these are all the raw ingredients we're processing through this factory. If all you put in is trash, it'd be hard to expect that we'd be manufacturing luxury goods or treasures. What we put into this factory is likely what we'll get out. Focus on the wrong thing, and you'll get the wrong result.\nSo, this calls for a level of radical honesty to unearth some truth and awareness about oneself; otherwise, what lies underneath remains hidden. What is it that motivates you? Are you too preoccupied with worldly pursuits? People like to think of themselves favorably and are over-confident in desirable traits (e.g., kindness, generosity, intelligence, disciplined, etc.), but would the world around you say the same?\nThe brain and body seeks to preserve, your ego wants to protect you from taking any punches and getting bruised. All this happens without our conscious knowledge, and so in a sense, we can be easily deluded. It takes constant examination to know this game of self-deceit and to understand the tricks of the brain before we can say we're \"acquainted\" or \"totally aware.\" We have to prove to others and to ourselves whether we qualify to be worthy of being called by a certain title or name.\n\n\n\n",

They fall further and further away from the fold of Islam by repeating the same mistake and are not mindful of the final judgment that awaits them.\n \u0625\u0650\u0646\u0651\u064e \u0671\u0644\u0651\u064e\u0630\u0650\u064a\u0646\u064e \u062a\u064e\u0648\u064e\u0644\u0651\u064e\u0648\u06e1\u0627\u0652 \u0645\u0650\u0646\u0643\u064f\u0645\u06e1 \u064a\u064e\u0648\u06e1\u0645\u064e \u0671\u0644\u06e1\u062a\u064e\u0642\u064e\u0649 \u0671\u0644\u06e1\u062c\u064e\u0645\u06e1\u0639\u064e\u0627\u0646\u0650 \u0625\u0650\u0646\u0651\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0627 \u0671\u0633\u06e1\u062a\u064e\u0632\u064e\u0644\u0651\u064e\u0647\u064f\u0645\u064f \u0671\u0644\u0634\u0651\u064e\u064a\u06e1\u0637\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064f \u0628\u0650\u0628\u064e\u0639\u06e1\u0636\u0650 \u0645\u064e\u0627 \u0643\u064e\u0633\u064e\u0628\u064f\u0648\u0627\u0652\u06d6 \u0648\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0642\u064e\u062f\u06e1 \u0639\u064e\u0641\u064e\u0627 \u0671\u0644\u0644\u0651\u064e\u0647\u064f \u0639\u064e\u0646\u06e1\u0647\u064f\u0645\u06e1\u06d7 \u0625\u0650\u0646\u0651\u064e \u0671\u0644\u0644\u0651\u064e\u0647\u064e \u063a\u064e\u0641\u064f\u0648\u0631\u064c \u062d\u064e\u0644\u0650\u064a\u0645\u065e\nInnal lazeena tawallaw minkum yawmal taqal jam'aani innamas tazallahumush Shaitaanu biba'di maa kasaboo wa laqad afal laahu anhum; innnal laaha Ghafoorun Haleem (section 16)\nEnglish Translation:\"Indeed, those of you who turned back on the day the two armies met, it was Satan who caused them to slip because of some [blame] they had earned.

And if they should cease, no one could hold them [in place] after Him. Indeed, He is Forbearing and Forgiving.\" \u2014 (Qur'an 35:41)\nReflection:We can try to characterize ourselves by this name to be known as 'Abd al-Haleem. This manifests in reality when we have a chance to take revenge but instead opt for forgiveness and gentleness. We take from the example mentioned in the Qur'an where it says, \"inna Ibraaheema la awwaahun haleem Surely, Ibrahim was most tender-hearted, God-fearing, forbearing.\" (Qur'an 9:114) Ibrahim (as) is described in the Qur'an as being awwaahun haleem. He loved His father because He was tender-hearted. This is despite the fact his father cruelly persecuted him and was an \"enemy to Allah,\" and died as a kafir (disbeliever). Yet he remained compassionate and made du'a asking for His forgiveness until Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 commanded Him to stop. And so, in the Qur'an Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 recognized Ibrahim (as) as being haleem.\nThe names of Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 do not describe a quality that is disliked in Himself. Rather, each name is beloved by Him, so if we have a share in it, it will please Him to see it emulated by His servant. At the root, Al-Haleem is an attribute of His love. Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 is not just the one who withholds punishment. He is patient just as a mother shows patience out of love for her children. Or like a good friend who knows your faults and your weaknesses. But they stick around and are genuinely concerned about what's best for you. We may push good friends away when we're doing wrong, but when that phase is over, they're still happy to help you with welcoming arms.\nIn the name Al-Lateef, we mentioned a hadith, but we'll expand on it a little further here. The Prophet Muhammad \ufdfa says to Aisha (ra): \"show gentleness, for if gentleness is found in anything, it beautifies it and when it is taken out from anything it damages it.\"\"[2] Positive feedback loops are powerful, probably much more than we'd like to give them credit. Being generous with compliments, especially when observing good, can encourage more of that behavior. Imagine how destructive it would be to a child's development if you were negative or talked down on them whenever they sought praise. The kid would feel lost or helpless. They would struggle to do what's right since they're trying to seek approval. Their entire moral compass is derived from immediate feedback from the environment. The comments of \"don't touch that\" and the gentleness of \"Masha-Allah, you did that!?\" are very instructive. We should strive for gentleness in every instance as it has the power to beautify the situation, and when it's removed from the equation, it damages it. We think as adults, we're not prone to this, but we are. When the effort from the act of making dinner goes unappreciated or, worse, criticized, the pain can be piercing. It can make you question why you even tried in the first place (the answer one can always find solace in is for Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670). At work, when the boss sincerely appreciates the work you've put in, it's rewarding. It beautifies the workspace, and we're happy to show up the next day.

He is Al-Azeem, The Greatest in all His beautiful qualities and attributes. This name is mentioned nine times in the Qur'an but is also used to describe things more generally as Azeem (tremendous). For example, His punishment in the hereafter is described as azeem. The Qur'an (15:87), the throne (27:26, 27:23), His grace (33:35), the day of judgment (83:5), the trials and tribulations of the children of Israel (7:141), His rewards (64:15), the upright character of Prophet Muhammad (\ufdfa) (68:4) are all referred to as azeem.\n \u0641\u064e\u0633\u064e\u0628\u0651\u0650\u062d\u0652 \u0628\u0650\u0671\u0633\u0652\u0645\u0650 \u0631\u064e\u0628\u0651\u0650\u0643\u064e \u0671\u0644\u0652\u0639\u064e\u0638\u0650\u064a\u0645\u0650\nFasabbih bismi rabbikal azeem\nEnglish Translation:\"So exalt the name of your Lord, the Most Great.\" \u2014 (Qur'an 55:96) & (Qur'an 69:52)\nConnecting with this name in your Salah:Be mindful of this name when you go into Ruku and recite, \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0627\u0646\u064e \u0631\u064e\u0628\u0651\u0650\u064a\u064e \u0627\u0644\u0652\u0639\u064e\u0638\u0650\u064a\u0645\u0650 subhana rabbiyal azeem meaning, \"Glorious is my Lord the Magnificent.\" [1] Think of the words you're saying as you recite them and understand the implications behind them.

There is no obstacle too large, no dream too big that Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 cannot fulfill. He can make any aspect of your life great. Even in the mundane, He can show you the beauty in it. The Prophet \ufdfa would make this du'a when distressed which calls upon two of Allah's attributes of being Al-Azim and Al-Haleem (The Clement One).\nNarrated Ibn Abbas: The Prophet \ufdfa used to invoke Allah at the time of distress, saying, [2]\n\u0644\u0627\u064e \u0625\u0650\u0644\u064e\u0647\u064e \u0625\u0650\u0644\u0627\u0651\u064e \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0651\u064e\u0647\u064f \u0627\u0644\u0652\u0639\u064e\u0638\u0650\u064a\u0645\u064f \u0627\u0644\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0644\u0650\u064a\u0645\u064f \u0644\u0627\u064e \u0625\u0650\u0644\u064e\u0647\u064e \u0625\u0650\u0644\u0627\u0651\u064e \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0651\u064e\u0647\u064f \u0631\u064e\u0628\u0651\u064f \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0651\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0648\u064e\u0627\u062a\u0650 \u0648\u064e\u0627\u0644\u0623\u064e\u0631\u0652\u0636\u0650 \u0631\u064e\u0628\u0651\u064f \u0627\u0644\u0652\u0639\u064e\u0631\u0652\u0634\u0650 \u0627\u0644\u0652\u0639\u064e\u0638\u0650\u064a\u0645\u0650 \nLa ilaha illal-lahu Al-`Azim, al- Halim, La ilaha illal-lahu Rabbu-s-samawati wal-ard wa Rabbu-l- arsh il-azim.\nEnglish Translation:\"There is no God but Allah, the Magnificent, the Forbearing. There is no God but Allah, Lord of the magnificent Throne. There is no God but Allah, Lord of the heavens and Earth, Lord of the generous Throne.\"\nHow to tip the scale in your favor with the name Al-Azim: The Prophet (\ufdfa) said, \"(There are) two words which are dear to the Beneficent (Allah) and very light (easy) for the tongue (to say), but very heavy in weight in the balance. They are: 'Subhan Allah wa-bi hamdihi' and 'Subhan Allah Al-Azim.\" [3]\nThis name also brings about humility in all who understand this attribute of Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670. As mentioned previously, a constant theme in many of these names is that we're deluded in worldly pursuits. A person who sees success can think of himself as being grandeur. But in reality, nothing can eclipse Allah's greatness. We can think of ourselves as big fish, not realizing we're swimming in a little pond.\nIn another case, we unknowingly may be influenced by a person with high status. Many fall into a trance of some sort, bending over backward to appease their demands. If, at that moment, Al-Azeem popped into your mind, it takes away the power they may hold over you. We realize yes, they may be wealthy, famous, and influential, but in comparison to Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 they are nothing.

There are three accompanying names, Al-Ghafir, Al-Ghaffar, and Al-Ghaffur. Al-Ghafir connotes His nature of being the forgiver, whereas Al-Ghaffar and Al-Ghaffur are more grandiose, meaning the great forgiver, the all-forgiving. Linguistically these two names are not synonymous even though both relate to the ideas of His forgiveness and share the same root. Scholars note that Al-Ghaffar describes His ability to forgive as being great. It is all-encompassing, doesn't matter the circumstance, the individuals, or the degree of sin. If Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 wills, He can forgive.

Indeed, Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.\" \u2014 (Qur'an 2:173)\n\n\nReflection:From this name, we learn the importance of maghfirah, which means to seek the forgiveness of Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670. The believer benefits in knowing that Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 is Al-Ghaffur because it reminds us that we worship an oft-forgiving Lord. Despite making the same mistake repeatedly, we're not doomed by our past.\nNarrated Abu Huraira: I heard the Prophet \ufdfa saying, \"If somebody commits a sin and then says, 'O my Lord! I have sinned, please forgive me!' And his Lord says, 'My servant has known that he has a Lord who forgives sins and punishes for it, I therefore have forgiven my servant (his sins).' Then he remains without committing any sin for a while and then again commits another sin and says, 'O my Lord, I have committed another sin, please forgive me,' and Allah says, 'My servant has known that he has a Lord who forgives sins and punishes for it, I therefore have forgiven my slave (his sin). Then he remains without Committing any another sin for a while and then commits another sin (for the third time) and says, 'O my Lord, I have committed another sin, please forgive me,' and Allah says, 'My servant knows that he has a Lord who forgives sins and punishes for it. I have forgiven My servant - three times.'\" [1]\nA du'a from Abu Bakr al-Sadiq (ra), \"O Allah, You know me better than I know myself, and I know myself better than these people who praise me. Make me better than what they think of me, and forgive those sins of mine of which they have no knowledge, and do not hold me responsible for what they say.\" [2] This covers an essential aspect of the names that share the root gh-f-r. It's not just a name of forgiveness but the idea of concealment. But not in a conniving way, to conceal something ugly and to beautify it. Allah conceals our faults from being exposed, so we're not under public scrutiny. It should inspire us to become better knowing we've been given a second, third, or fourth chance and to help uplift others. So, His mercy extends to forgive perpetually and to hide our faults from being exposed.\nAbu Huraira reported Allah's Apostle \ufdfa as saying: The servant (whose fault) Allah conceals in this world, Allah would also conceal (his faults) on the Day of Resurrection.  [3] and in a different narration, Abu Huraira reported Allah's Apostle (\ufdfa) as saying: The servant (who conceals) the faults of others in this world, Allah would conceal his faults on the Day of Resurrection. [4]\nThe analogy often used is that every time we sin, a crack appears, which uncovers or exposes us. When we ask for istighfar (seeking Allah's forgiveness) - we're asking for Him to show us His mercy, to protect us by repairing or covering what's been exposed. Indeed Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 is both Al-Ghaffar (The Great Forgiver), the one who forgives big and small sins, and Al-Ghaffur (The Oft-Forgiver), the one who forgives time and time again.\nReferences:\n[1] Sahih al-Bukhari 7507\n[2] Silsilah al-Huda wa Noor no. 640\n[3] Sahih Muslim 2590a \n[4] Sahih Muslim 2590b\n\n\n",

Nay, it is Allah that recogniseth (all good), and knoweth all things.\" \u2014 (Qur'an 4:147 )\nMultiplying good deeds:Moreover, He is the one who multiples the rewards of His servant's many folds. It is also only Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 who has the power to multiple without any measure or restriction. As an illustrative example, here's what the Messenger of Allah \ufdfa said on good deeds committed while fasting: \"Every good deed of the son of Adam will be multiplied manifold. A good deed will be multiplied ten times up to as many as seven hundred times, or as much as Allah wills.\" [1] Also, Ibn Umar narrated that one day: The Messenger of Allah \ufdfa said to his Companions: \u201cSay \u2018Glory is to Allah and with His Praise (Subhan Allah, wa bihamdih) a hundred times. Whoever says [it] one time, it is written for him ten, and whoever says it ten (times), it is written for him a hundred, and whoever says it a hundred (times), it is written for him a thousand, and whoever increases, Allah will increase for him, and whoever seeks Allah\u2019s forgiveness, [Allah] will forgive him.\u201d [2]\nPairing Al-Ghafur and Al-Shakur:\n \u0648\u064e\u0642\u064e\u0627\u0644\u064f\u0648\u0627\u0652 \u0671\u0644\u06e1\u062d\u064e\u0645\u06e1\u062f\u064f \u0644\u0650\u0644\u0651\u064e\u0647\u0650 \u0671\u0644\u0651\u064e\u0630\u0650\u064a\u0653 \u0623\u064e\u0630\u06e1\u0647\u064e\u0628\u064e \u0639\u064e\u0646\u0651\u064e\u0627 \u0671\u0644\u06e1\u062d\u064e\u0632\u064e\u0646\u064e\u06d6 \u0625\u0650\u0646\u0651\u064e \u0631\u064e\u0628\u0651\u064e\u0646\u064e\u0627 \u0644\u064e\u063a\u064e\u0641\u064f\u0648\u0631\u065e \u0634\u064e\u0643\u064f\u0648\u0631\u064c\nWa qaalul hamdu lillaahil lazeee azhaba \u2018annal hazan; inna Rabbanaa la Ghafoorun Shakoor\nEnglish Translation:\"And they will say, \u201cPraise to Allah, who has removed from us [all] sorrow. Indeed, our Lord is Forgiving and Appreciative \u2013\" \u2014 (Qur'an 35:34)\nThis pairing of names here conveys Allah's nature of showing mercy and seeing the good in us. Put another way, He frequently forgives, cleansing us of our many sins. He is also accepting of all good that we do, no matter how inconsequential it may appear.\n\n\nThe promise of Jannah:The promise of an eternal paradise for a short-lived time on earth doing good deeds is an example of an immense reward for relatively little effort. In the Qur'an, it says to the people in paradise, \"[They will be told], 'Eat and drink in satisfaction for what you put forth in the days past.'\" (Qur'an 69:24) Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 recognizes and rewards the action of His servants. This is why it's important to do good, even when no one sees it. To do good for its own sake because Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 will reward us for it. Any acknowledgment from the outside world is a bonus. Being recognized through an award is nice to have. The real reward we should seek is from Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 who always gives within measure or more than what's due.\nReflection:A believer benefits from knowing that Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 is al-Shakur. If Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 can be grateful to His servants when He has no need to be, and He continually forgives and rewards; then perhaps we can learn to be the same amongst ourselves. In a hadith, Prophet Muhammad \ufdfa conveys a similar message, \"He who does not thank the people is not thankful to Allah.\" [3]\nThis is also a reminder to thank Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670, praise Him for His gratitude. Even this will render some benefit to you, as Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 says in the Qur'an, \"If you are grateful, I will surely increase you [in favor]\" (Qur'an 14:17) and also, \"If you disbelieve \u2013 indeed, Allah is Free from need of you. And He does not approve for His servants disbelief. And if you are grateful, He approves it for you; and no bearer of burdens will bear the burden of another. Then to your Lord is your return, and He will inform you about what you used to do. Indeed, He is Knowing of that within the breasts [hearts].\" (Qur'an 39:7). Our praise and obedience will work in a loop that only further propels us to the entrance of Jannah. We can never do enough to repay the blessings He has bestowed on us. We should try to keep this front of mind as we can feel immense happiness and love to know we have such a loving and appreciative creator.\n \u0630\u064e\u0670\u0644\u0650\u0643\u064e \u0671\u0644\u0651\u064e\u0630\u0650\u064a \u064a\u064f\u0628\u064e\u0634\u0651\u0650\u0631\u064f \u0671\u0644\u0644\u0651\u064e\u0647\u064f \u0639\u0650\u0628\u064e\u0627\u062f\u064e\u0647\u064f \u0671\u0644\u0651\u064e\u0630\u0650\u064a\u0646\u064e \u0621\u064e\u0627\u0645\u064e\u0646\u064f\u0648\u0627\u0652 \u0648\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0645\u0650\u0644\u064f\u0648\u0627\u0652 \u0671\u0644\u0635\u0651\u064e\u0640\u0670\u0644\u0650\u062d\u064e\u0670\u062a\u0650\u06d7 \u0642\u064f\u0644 \u0644\u0651\u064e\u0627\u0653 \u0623\u064e\u0633\u06e1\u0640\u0654\u064e\u0644\u064f\u0643\u064f\u0645\u06e1 \u0639\u064e\u0644\u064e\u064a\u06e1\u0647\u0650 \u0623\u064e\u062c\u06e1\u0631\u064b\u0627 \u0625\u0650\u0644\u0651\u064e\u0627 \u0671\u0644\u06e1\u0645\u064e\u0648\u064e\u062f\u0651\u064e\u0629\u064e \u0641\u0650\u064a \u0671\u0644\u06e1\u0642\u064f\u0631\u06e1\u0628\u064e\u0649\u0670\u06d7 \u0648\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0646 \u064a\u064e\u0642\u06e1\u062a\u064e\u0631\u0650\u0641\u06e1 \u062d\u064e\u0633\u064e\u0646\u064e\u0629\u0657 \u0646\u0651\u064e\u0632\u0650\u062f\u06e1 \u0644\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0641\u0650\u064a\u0647\u064e\u0627 \u062d\u064f\u0633\u06e1\u0646\u064b\u0627\u06da \u0625\u0650\u0646\u0651\u064e \u0671\u0644\u0644\u0651\u064e\u0647\u064e \u063a\u064e\u0641\u064f\u0648\u0631\u065e \u0634\u064e\u0643\u064f\u0648\u0631\u064c\nZaalikal lazee yubash shirul laahu \u2018ibaadahul lazeena aamanoo wa \u2018amilus saalihaat; qul laaa as\u2019alukum \u2018alaihi ajran illal mawaddata fil qurbaa; wa mai yaqtarif hasanatan nazid lahoo feehaa husnaa; innal laaha Ghafoorun Shakoor\nEnglish Translation:\"It is that of which Allah gives good tidings to His servants who believe and do righteous deeds.

This is separate from the 78th name, Al-Muta'Ali, which means The High Above, The Exalted. These names describe the transcendent nature of Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 and His loftiness when compared to all other creations. Imam al-Ghazali mentions, \"[He] is the one above whose rank there is no rank, and all ranks are inferior to Him. This is because high is derived from 'height', and 'height' is taken from elevation that is the opposite of lowness.\" Al-Aliyy is the all-high without any reference point. This is an intrinsic quality. Al-Muta-Ali is a variation that is a more intensified form.\nIn the Qur'an, the name Al-Ala appears five times, Al-Aliyy five, and Al-Muta'Ali only once.\n \u0633\u064e\u0628\u0651\u0650\u062d\u0650 \u0671\u0633\u0652\u0645\u064e \u0631\u064e\u0628\u0651\u0650\u0643\u064e \u0671\u0644\u0652\u0623\u064e\u0639\u0652\u0644\u064e\u0649\nSabbihisma Rabbikal A'laa\nEnglish Translation:\"Exalt the name of your Lord, the Most High,\" \u2014 (Qur'an 87:1)\nConnecting with this name in your salah:His essence to being above His creation in a literal sense.

We make du'a seeking His guidance or help. Another act of submission is how we bow our heads in ruku or sujood to show He \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 is higher. At our lowest point in sujood (prostration), we say, Subhana Rabbi Al Ala meaning, \"Glory is to my Lord, the Most High.\"[1] And in the Qur'an, \"They fear their Lord above them, and they do what they are commanded.\" (Qur'an 16:50)\nAllah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 is above:The other meaning refers to the highness of His attributes being above all. He is above all creation in all respects. As we've studied up to this name of Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670, many of His qualities often indicate a form of being grand or perpetual. That is why it's The Most Merciful, The Most Gracious, The All-Hearing, and The All-Seeing.\nBeing above the Throne:\"It is He who created the heavens and earth in six days and then established Himself above the Throne. He knows what penetrates into the earth and what emerges from it and what descends from the heaven and what ascends therein; and He is with you wherever you are. And Allah, of what you do, is Seeing.\" (Quran 57:4) It is oft-mentioned in the Qur'an that Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 is above the Throne or ascended the Throne, (i.e., sits on the Throne).\nThe throne is often interpreted as being the place which Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 governs the entire universe, the place where He showers blessings of life and power.

In the call to prayer (i.e., the adhan), we say Allahu Akabar meaning \"Allah is greater.\" This contains the importance of salah time, to stop all that you're doing when the adhan comes on, and hayya alas salah, meaning \"come to prayer.\" Why? Because God is greater - He is greater than whatever else may be preoccupying your time. Here it seems to be used in the comparative sense, but really it's an affirmation of Allah's absoluteness.\nAlthough the reference to the last verse of Surah Jumuah is about Jumuah prayer, the message remains true for all your prayers, \"O you who have believed, when [the adhan] is called for the prayer on the day of Jumu\u2019ah [Friday], then proceed to the remembrance of Allah and leave trade. That is better for you, if you only knew.\" It's only befitting that the next part in the adhan mentions hayya alal falah \"come to success.\" Narrated `Abdullah: I asked the Prophet (\ufdfa) \"Which deed is the dearest to Allah?\" He replied, \"To offer the prayers at their early stated fixed times.\" [1]\nAl-Kabir - testament of tawhid:Upon realizing only Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 possesses true greatness, we, therefore, praise Him alone.

Allah is the Greatest of the great and all praise is due to Him. Hallowed be Allah, the Lord of the worlds, there is no Might and Power but that of Allah, the All-Powerful and the Wise.\"\nThe Greatness within you:Another way a believer benefits from knowing Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 is Al-Kabeer is acknowledging and respecting the beauty that is you. If we understand the superlative that Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 is the highest and greatest then it must be that everything that comes from Him must be perfect and great in its own respect. Whether or not we recognize and accept our beauty and our greatness is a different question altogether. To begin transforming self-loathing to self-loving has to do with reprogramming the story that's been conditioned in your psyche and reworking it. It takes some believing and trust to attach a new story to take its place, and whose word is greater to follow and trust than Al-Kabeer?\nIn the Qur'an, Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 mentions His creation as being molded perfectly, \"It is Allah who made for you the earth a place of settlement and the sky a ceiling and formed you and perfected your forms and provided you with good things. That is Allah, your Lord; then blessed is Allah, Lord of the worlds.\" (Qur'an 40:64) and also, \"We have certainly created man in the best of stature;\" Qur'an 95:4 Would you refute Him, saying, \"look, I respect your opinion but I am objectively ugly. See my left eye is slightly bigger than my right!\" It may seem ridiculous, but we are all guilty of doing this in some fashion. This is probably even more exaggerated today because of the high beauty standards pushed on by social media.\nAnother beautiful ayat from the Qur'an worth deeply reflecting on is, \"You now see the mountains and consider them firmly fixed, but then they shall pass away even as clouds pass away. That will be the handiwork of Allah Who has created everything with perfect wisdom. He is well aware of what you do.\" (Qur'an 27:88) The commentators of the Qur'an interpret \"pass away\" as a reference to the Earth itself, meaning that the world, believed to be solid, is actually as ephemeral as a cloud. It is temporary.\nWe can even try to extrapolate from this ayah on a personal level. Things that may seem firmly fixed will pass. If we can accept this, we can learn to let go of any emotional attachments. There is nothing that exists with absolute permanence but Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670. Holding on to what was or is, is an impossible task. The one who caused the change is Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670, and He is the one who has perfect wisdom.\nWe can experience inner peace only with acceptance of what He has willed. If we're flexible with changing events, we can see the many blessings Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 has given each one of us. Try to drop the anxiety and self-criticism if you're not doing what you feel you're supposed to be doing - or where you think you should be. Harsh criticism of yourself serves no purpose but to hinder future progress. Instead, just focus on the smallest step you can take to improve your situation. Just as Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 spreads His perfection through His creation, we work to perfect our inner character. Emotional temperance, knowledge, deen, love, family, friendships, etc. Whatever else happens is up to Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670, and we know that He is Al-Kabeer, The Greatest.\nReferences:\n[1] Sahih al-Bukhari 527\n[2] Hasan (Darussalam) Sunan Ibn Majah 4174 & Sahih (Al-Albani) Sunan Abi Dawud 4090\n[3] Sahih Muslim 2696\n\n\n",

There are different aspects of this name we can explore. Imam al-Ghazali writes the first is \"perpetuating the existence of existing things and sustaining them, the opposite of which is annihilation.\" In this light, we see Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 as the preserver in the sense of being a protector.

This is how birds know to migrate south for the winter, how bees can travel 12km away from the hive and find their way back, how salmons return to the same river bank they were born to lay their eggs despite having traveled hundreds to thousands of miles away in the vast ocean. It's jaw-dropping to consider how different elements that are at odds with one another (e.g., hot and cold, dryness and wetness) exist under our skin in the perfect balance because Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 has reconciled them to be that way. The human body is a powerful self-regulating system. If you look at the average body temperature in humans, it exists within a small range of 36.1 C - 37.2 C. The same is true of our blood pH level, hovering around 7.35 to 7.45. The slightest diversion from this range can have very harmful effects. Yet, within our body, the pH level of the acid in our stomach is 1.5-2.5. If this came in direct contact with your skin, it would burn a hole through your flesh. But Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 \u2014 great and glorious \u2014 made it so our stomach can safely house this acid for self-preservation to help eat and digest food.\n \u0641\u064e\u0625\u0650\u0646 \u062a\u064e\u0648\u064e\u0644\u0651\u064e\u0648\u06e1\u0627\u0652 \u0641\u064e\u0642\u064e\u062f\u06e1 \u0623\u064e\u0628\u06e1\u0644\u064e\u063a\u06e1\u062a\u064f\u0643\u064f\u0645 \u0645\u0651\u064e\u0627\u0653 \u0623\u064f\u0631\u06e1\u0633\u0650\u0644\u06e1\u062a\u064f \u0628\u0650\u0647\u0650\u06e6\u0653 \u0625\u0650\u0644\u064e\u064a\u06e1\u0643\u064f\u0645\u06e1\u06da \u0648\u064e\u064a\u064e\u0633\u06e1\u062a\u064e\u062e\u06e1\u0644\u0650\u0641\u064f \u0631\u064e\u0628\u0651\u0650\u064a \u0642\u064e\u0648\u06e1\u0645\u064b\u0627 \u063a\u064e\u064a\u06e1\u0631\u064e\u0643\u064f\u0645\u06e1 \u0648\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0627 \u062a\u064e\u0636\u064f\u0631\u0651\u064f\u0648\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0634\u064e\u064a\u06e1\u0640\u0654\u064b\u0627\u06da \u0625\u0650\u0646\u0651\u064e \u0631\u064e\u0628\u0651\u0650\u064a \u0639\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 \u0643\u064f\u0644\u0651\u0650 \u0634\u064e\u064a\u06e1\u0621\u064d \u062d\u064e\u0641\u0650\u064a\u0638\u065e\nFa in tawallaw faqad ablaghtukum maaa ursiltu biheee ilaikum; wa yastakhlifu Rabbee qawman ghairakum wa laa tadur roonahoo shai\u2019aa; inna Rabbee \u2018alaa kulli shai\u2019in Hafeez\nEnglish Translation:But if they turn away, [say], 'I have already conveyed that with which I was sent to you.

It also calls upon Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 by many names which we have covered up until this point. Can you identify them? [2]\nReflection:Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 has provided the answers to things that threaten our existence and our harmony and taught us how to be protected from them. He sent this through His books and His teachers (i.e., the Prophets, may peace be upon them). He tells us to be cautious and avoid the poisons of gambling, alcohol, adultery, backbiting, envy, jealousy, and ignorance. He advocates for charity, lawful marriages, looking after your community, seeking knowledge, become intelligent and useful. He's not denied us enjoyment and complete detachment from all things. We're encouraged to enjoy what's permissible while keeping our duties and responsibilities.\nBy studying the name Al-Hafeedh, it should inspire us to further rely upon Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670. We should seek to mimic this attribute in small ways, to give our best effort to memorize the Qur'an and become a Hafiz. This is probably too big of a task, so break it down and be a \"preserver\" of a few small surahs. Narrated Abu Hurairah: The Prophet \ufdfa said: \"The one who memorized the Qur'an shall come on the Day of Judgment and (the reward for reciting the Qur'an) says: 'O Lord! Decorate him.\" So he is donned with a crown of nobility. Then it says: \"O Lord! Give him more!\" So he is donned with a suit of nobility. Then it says: \"O Lord! Be pleased with him.' So He is pleased with him and says: \"Recite and rise up, and be increased in reward with every Ayah.\"\" [3]\nWe must also try to preserve our deen and our character from being corrupted by sin. The Shaitan will try to pull us in many directions. He will encourage us to get angry about small things, to let down over here, and to give in to some temptations over there. We must actively fight to preserve our faith. We should also seek to preserve things encouraged in Islam, kindness to one another, love among the community, and keeping the peace. The only justification for fighting is against oppression and tyranny.\nReferences:\n[1] Sahih (Darussalam) Jami at-Tirmidhi 2884\n[2] Five names: Allah, Al-Hayy, Al-Qayyum, Al-Aliyy, Al-Azeem.

Spiritual Needs:The name of Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670, Al-Muqeet - The Nourisher. We all require sustenance and nourishment. At first, we require physical nourishment, food, and drink being the strongest of needs. Once that need is satiated, we often experience an inner void, and some mistakenly believe it can only be filled with material things. After all the hoarding and consuming, they will find this hole is a bottomless pit that can never be filled. The nourishment they need can only be found in the light of Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670. Through devotion to Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 and increasing their spiritual aspirations, they fill the missing piece. In this way, Al-Muqit is the spiritual nourisher.\nBut Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 also has prescribed physical nourishment. Every person has it written for him/her what nourishment is available, and no one can come in the way of limiting what's been ordained. It was narrated from Jabir bin Abdullah that the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) said: \"O people, fear Allah and be moderate in seeking a living, for no soul will die until it has received all its provision, even if it is slow in coming. So fear Allah and be moderate in seeking provision; take that which is permissible and leave that which is forbidden.\"  [1] So in this sense, it's similar to the meaning of the name Ar-Razzaq (The Provider) but more emphasis on the spiritual aspect. Imam al-Ghazali writes, \"this name is more specific, since provision includes what is other than food as well as food.\" As the name of Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 it is only mentioned once in the Qur'an.\n \u0645\u0651\u064e\u0646 \u064a\u064e\u0634\u06e1\u0641\u064e\u0639\u06e1 \u0634\u064e\u0641\u064e\u0670\u0639\u064e\u0629\u064b \u062d\u064e\u0633\u064e\u0646\u064e\u0629\u0657 \u064a\u064e\u0643\u064f\u0646 \u0644\u0651\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0646\u064e\u0635\u0650\u064a\u0628\u065e \u0645\u0651\u0650\u0646\u06e1\u0647\u064e\u0627\u06d6 \u0648\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0646 \u064a\u064e\u0634\u06e1\u0641\u064e\u0639\u06e1 \u0634\u064e\u0641\u064e\u0670\u0639\u064e\u0629\u0657 \u0633\u064e\u064a\u0651\u0650\u0626\u064e\u0629\u0657 \u064a\u064e\u0643\u064f\u0646 \u0644\u0651\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0643\u0650\u0641\u06e1\u0644\u065e \u0645\u0651\u0650\u0646\u06e1\u0647\u064e\u0627\u06d7 \u0648\u064e\u0643\u064e\u0627\u0646\u064e \u0671\u0644\u0644\u0651\u064e\u0647\u064f \u0639\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 \u0643\u064f\u0644\u0651\u0650 \u0634\u064e\u064a\u06e1\u0621\u0656 \u0645\u0651\u064f\u0642\u0650\u064a\u062a\u0657\u0627\nMai yashfa shafaa\u2019atan hasanatay yakul lahoo naseebum minhaa wa mai yashfa shafaa\u2019atan saiyi'atany-yakul lahoo kiflum minhaa; wa kaanal laahu 'alaa kulli shai'im Muqeetaa\nEnglish Translation:\"Whoever intercedes for a good cause will have a reward therefrom; and whoever intercedes for an evil cause will have a burden therefrom.

To give without sparing or scanting, to give without the receiver\u2019s expectation. To suffice, to be sufficient, or without measure.\nAl-Muqeet and Al-Haseeb:The previous name we discussed is Al-Muqeet which is closely related to Al-Haseeb. Al-Muqit is The Nourisher. He provides for our sustenance in a variety of ways - both material and spiritual. Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 has given each one of us a varying degree of intellectual ability as well as a certain amount of wealth and time to spend however we wish.\nNow, Hasib comes from hasaba, which means to count (past tense), calculate, or account. He is the one who measures and reckons. So, in a way, Al-Muqeet is the one who fills us with life, knowledge, and wealth, and Al-Haseeb is the one who is constantly measuring. He is checking to see whether these gifts are squandered or utilized. So, in the perpetual form, Al-Hasib is \"The Accountant,\" who watches every action and deed and will settle all accounts.\n \u0671\u0644\u0651\u064e\u0630\u0650\u064a\u0646\u064e \u064a\u064f\u0628\u064e\u0644\u0651\u0650\u063a\u064f\u0648\u0646\u064e \u0631\u0650\u0633\u064e\u0640\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0640\u0670\u062a\u0650 \u0671\u0644\u0644\u0651\u064e\u0647\u0650 \u0648\u064e\u064a\u064e\u062e\u0652\u0634\u064e\u0648\u0652\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0627 \u064a\u064e\u062e\u0652\u0634\u064e\u0648\u0652\u0646\u064e \u0623\u064e\u062d\u064e\u062f\u064b\u0627 \u0625\u0650\u0644\u0651\u064e\u0627 \u0671\u0644\u0644\u0651\u064e\u0647\u064e \u06d7 \u0648\u064e\u0643\u064e\u0641\u064e\u0649\u0670 \u0628\u0650\u0671\u0644\u0644\u0651\u064e\u0647\u0650 \u062d\u064e\u0633\u0650\u064a\u0628\u064b\u06ed\u0627\nAllazeena yuballighoona Risaalaatil laahi wa yakhshaw nahoo wa laa yakkhshawna ahadan illal laah; wa kafaa billaahi Haseebaa\nEnglish Translation:\"[Allah praises] those who convey the messages of Allah and fear Him and do not fear anyone but Allah. And sufficient is Allah as Accountant.\" \u2014 (Qur'an 33:39)\nOther Interpretations:Al-Haseeb is also understood to be a name of Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 that demonstrates the attribute of His knowledge. He knows the result of every creation. Nothing surprises Him. On the day of reckoning, they will stand before Him bringing their accounts of whatever good they've accumulated. Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 does not need to perform any calculations. He knows the result. There is no inaccuracy or impreciseness in His judgment. He takes everything into account and does not miss any detail.\nAnother meaning of Al-Hasib is sufficiency. He is sufficient, not needing anyone or anything. Nothing is truly self-sufficient besides Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670. If something were self-sustaining, it would not need anything for its existence. There is nothing but Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 that posseses this quality. But yet, a common desire is to be self-reliant, but this term is often misused and misunderstood. What we really mean is we need Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 to take care of us and help us in our affairs.

And if there is [even] the weight of a mustard seed, We will bring it forth. And sufficient are We as accountant.\" \u2014 (Qur'an 21:47)\n\n\nReflection:From this attribute of Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 we can learn not to undermine any act of good. There is no deed too small. Any chance to do good should be taken with utmost urgency because, on the day of reckoning, we would wish to have a chance to replay those moments and do things differently. So this name reminds us not to waste a moment to do good and go the extra mile because most people won't. Be an extraordinary individual, always looking and observing to find a way to help people. Don't squander your time on earth as 'The Accountant' is watching how you spend the greatest capital of all, which is your time.\nBe courteous, and don't be afraid to be different. Run to the kitchen the next time someone says they are thirsty and see how weirdly they'll look at you. Another example the Qur'an teaches us is to greet the person who says salam with one that's better than it (i.e., Assalamualaikum being the base, Assalamualaikum Warahmatullah being one greater, and Assalamualaikum Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh being the greatest of them all). Imagine the strange looks if, in the English language, we did the same. Your friend says, \"Hey,\" and you respond, \"Hi, hope you're doing better than good and better than most, May Allah shower His peace and blessings upon you!\"\nNow, in every interaction, you're given a chance to have that same effect, not just with being over the top with your words but with your presence, alertness, attention, and overall care for the other person. When someone really cares, we can feel it. It's an intuitive feeling and hard to fake. But it can be worked on and improved. What if this was your last conversation with that person? How would that change the dynamics of the way you approach the interaction?\n \u0645\u0651\u064e\u0646 \u064a\u064e\u0634\u06e1\u0641\u064e\u0639\u06e1 \u0634\u064e\u0641\u064e\u0670\u0639\u064e\u0629\u064b \u062d\u064e\u0633\u064e\u0646\u064e\u0629\u0657 \u064a\u064e\u0643\u064f\u0646 \u0644\u0651\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0646\u064e\u0635\u0650\u064a\u0628\u065e \u0645\u0651\u0650\u0646\u06e1\u0647\u064e\u0627\u06d6 \u0648\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0646 \u064a\u064e\u0634\u06e1\u0641\u064e\u0639\u06e1 \u0634\u064e\u0641\u064e\u0670\u0639\u064e\u0629\u0657 \u0633\u064e\u064a\u0651\u0650\u0626\u064e\u0629\u0657 \u064a\u064e\u0643\u064f\u0646 \u0644\u0651\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0643\u0650\u0641\u06e1\u0644\u065e \u0645\u0651\u0650\u0646\u06e1\u0647\u064e\u0627\u06d7 \u0648\u064e\u0643\u064e\u0627\u0646\u064e \u0671\u0644\u0644\u0651\u064e\u0647\u064f \u0639\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 \u0643\u064f\u0644\u0651\u0650 \u0634\u064e\u064a\u06e1\u0621\u0656 \u0645\u0651\u064f\u0642\u0650\u064a\u062a\u0657\u0627\n \u0648\u064e\u0625\u0650\u0630\u064e\u0627 \u062d\u064f\u064a\u0651\u0650\u064a\u062a\u064f\u0645 \u0628\u0650\u062a\u064e\u062d\u0650\u064a\u0651\u064e\u0629\u0656 \u0641\u064e\u062d\u064e\u064a\u0651\u064f\u0648\u0627\u0652 \u0628\u0650\u0623\u064e\u062d\u06e1\u0633\u064e\u0646\u064e \u0645\u0650\u0646\u06e1\u0647\u064e\u0627\u0653 \u0623\u064e\u0648\u06e1 \u0631\u064f\u062f\u0651\u064f\u0648\u0647\u064e\u0627\u0653\u06d7 \u0625\u0650\u0646\u0651\u064e \u0671\u0644\u0644\u0651\u064e\u0647\u064e \u0643\u064e\u0627\u0646\u064e \u0639\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 \u0643\u064f\u0644\u0651\u0650 \u0634\u064e\u064a\u06e1\u0621\u064d \u062d\u064e\u0633\u0650\u064a\u0628\u064b\u0627\nMai yashfa shafaa'atan hasanatay yakul lahoo naseebum minhaa wa mai yashfa shafaa'atan saiyi'atany-yakul lahoo kiflum minhaa; wa kaanal laahu alaa kulli shai\u2019im Muqeetaa Wa izaa huyyeetum bitahaiyyatin fahaiyoo bi ahsana minhaaa aw ruddoohaa; innal laaha kaana alaa kulli shai'in Haseeba\nEnglish Translation:\"Whoever intercedes for a good cause will have a reward therefrom; and whoever intercedes for an evil cause will have a burden therefrom.

To be glorious, majestic. To be sublime, to be high, lofty, far above, independent. The word Jalal (\u062c\u0644\u0627\u0644) comes from the same root meaning greatness, majestic, and loftiness.\nAmong the disputed names:As we've mentioned in previous names, different scholars have different criteria for what qualifies as a name of Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670. Of the 99 names, 81 are explicitly mentioned in the Qur'an. Therefore, there is not one agreed-upon list for the remaining 18 names. Al-Jalil is one of those names which is not included by certain scholars. This list includes Ibn al-Wazir, Ibn Hajar, and Ibn al-Uthaymeen. However, others, such as Ibn Arabi, Imam al-Bayhaqi, and Imam al-Ghazali, have included this name in their books of explanations of Asma ul-Husna.

What does it mean to be absolutely majestic? It means you have complete knowledge, strength, sovereignty, wealth, power, and dominion, among all the other attributes. His majesty is unique and immeasurable. It bears no resemblance to anything past, present, or future. There are many names which denote Allah's \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 greatness. For example, Al-Jalil is 'The Majestic' because of the perfection of all His attributes/qualities. Al-Kabir (the great), whose very essence is to be perfect. Al-Azeem (the magnificent one) - the one described as tremendous because of His attributes.

The other attributes (i.e., mercy, kindness, care, provision, sustenance) are attributes of beauty (Jamal). It is said by scholars all of His names are either attributes of Jalal or Jamal. They are also interrelated, the majesty of Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 is His beauty, and His beauty is His majesty.\nWhen Allah revealed Himself to Musa (as):\n \u0648\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0645\u0651\u064e\u0627 \u062c\u064e\u0627\u0653\u0621\u064e \u0645\u064f\u0648\u0633\u064e\u0649\u0670 \u0644\u0650\u0645\u0650\u064a\u0642\u064e\u0640\u0670\u062a\u0650\u0646\u064e\u0627 \u0648\u064e\u0643\u064e\u0644\u0651\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0631\u064e\u0628\u0651\u064f\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0642\u064e\u0627\u0644\u064e \u0631\u064e\u0628\u0651\u0650 \u0623\u064e\u0631\u0650\u0646\u0650\u0649\u0653 \u0623\u064e\u0646\u0638\u064f\u0631\u0652 \u0625\u0650\u0644\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0643\u064e \u06da \u0642\u064e\u0627\u0644\u064e \u0644\u064e\u0646 \u062a\u064e\u0631\u064e\u0649\u0670\u0646\u0650\u0649 \u0648\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0640\u0670\u0643\u0650\u0646\u0650 \u0671\u0646\u0638\u064f\u0631\u0652 \u0625\u0650\u0644\u064e\u0649 \u0671\u0644\u0652\u062c\u064e\u0628\u064e\u0644\u0650 \u0641\u064e\u0625\u0650\u0646\u0650 \u0671\u0633\u0652\u062a\u064e\u0642\u064e\u0631\u0651\u064e \u0645\u064e\u0643\u064e\u0627\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0641\u064e\u0633\u064e\u0648\u0652\u0641\u064e \u062a\u064e\u0631\u064e\u0649\u0670\u0646\u0650\u0649 \u06da \u0641\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0645\u0651\u064e\u0627 \u062a\u064e\u062c\u064e\u0644\u0651\u064e\u0649\u0670 \u0631\u064e\u0628\u0651\u064f\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0644\u0650\u0644\u0652\u062c\u064e\u0628\u064e\u0644\u0650 \u062c\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u062f\u064e\u0643\u0651\u064b\u06ed\u0627 \u0648\u064e\u062e\u064e\u0631\u0651\u064e \u0645\u064f\u0648\u0633\u064e\u0649\u0670 \u0635\u064e\u0639\u0650\u0642\u064b\u06ed\u0627 \u06da \u0641\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0645\u0651\u064e\u0627\u0653 \u0623\u064e\u0641\u064e\u0627\u0642\u064e \u0642\u064e\u0627\u0644\u064e \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0640\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0643\u064e \u062a\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062a\u064f \u0625\u0650\u0644\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0643\u064e \u0648\u064e\u0623\u064e\u0646\u064e\u0627\u06e0 \u0623\u064e\u0648\u0651\u064e\u0644\u064f \u0671\u0644\u0652\u0645\u064f\u0624\u0652\u0645\u0650\u0646\u0650\u064a\u0646\u064e\nWa lammaa jaaa\u2019a Moosa limeeqaatinaa wa kallamahoo Rabbuhoo qaala Rabbi arineee anzur ilaik; qaala lan taraanee wa laakininzur ilal jabali fa inistaqarra makaanahoo fasawfa taraanee; falammaa tajallaa Rabbuhoo liljabali ja\u2019alahoo dakkanw wa kharra Moosaa sa\u2019iqaa; falammaaa afaaqa qaala Subhaanaka tubtu ilaika wa ana awwalul mu\u2019mineen\nEnglish Translation:\"And when Moses arrived at Our appointed time and his Lord spoke to him, he said, 'My Lord, show me [Yourself] that I may look at You.' [Allah] said, 'You will not see Me, but look at the mountain; if it should remain in place, then you will see Me.' But when his Lord appeared to the mountain, He rendered it level, and Moses fell unconscious. And when he awoke, he said, \u201cExalted are You! I have repented to You, and I am the first of the believers.'\" \u2014 (Qur'an 7:143)\nThis ayah explains how Musa (as) asked to see Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670. But Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 responded that no one could bear to see Him, warning Musa (as) of the danger. Instead, He made His presence to a nearby mountain. What followed was the decimation of that mountain. It was said the mountain was leveled or flattened, meaning it was transformed into a flat land or a small hill. In that split second, just being close to His presence, Musa (as) fainted.\n\n\nReflection:The connection of this story with the name Al-Jalil is Allah's beauty and majesty can't be understood through sight. The way we metaphorically see Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 is through the study and understanding of the attributes that make Him \"The All-Majestic.\" Imam al-Ghazali writes of Allah's attributes, \"and that is beautiful comportment 'or' beautiful disposition' perceived by insight rather than by sight.\" The one who understands how the inner has been perfected and properly proportioned will gain much more understanding and satisfaction than the one who judges beauty just by sight.\nIn this hadith, we see where the attribute of Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 as being called al-Jaleel originates, Mu'adh ibn Jabal narrated that the Messenger of Allah \ufdfa said: \"Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, said: 'Those who love each other for the sake of My Majesty (\u062c\u064e\u0644\u0627\u064e\u0644\u0650\u064a) shall be upon podiums of light, and they will be admired by the Prophets and the martyrs.'\" [1]\nThis also covers the important topic of loving for the sake of Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670. It's a message that encourages us never to stop searching for the good in humanity. To love your fellow person unconditionally because that's what Allah loves and will reward us for doing. Abu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger \ufdfa as saying: Verily. Allah would say on the Day of Resurrection: Where are those who have a mutual love for My Glory's sake? Today I shall shelter them in My shadow when there is no other shadow but the shadow of Mine. [2]\nThe believer further benefits from knowing and understanding Al-Jalil by trying to perfect his interior attributes. Doing so will bring more beauty and pleasure into this world than any superficial looks could bring. As Imam Ghazali writes, \"exterior beauty is of lesser worth.\"\nReferences:\n[1] Sahih (Darussalam) Jami` at-Tirmidhi 2390\n[2] Sahih Muslim 2566\n\n\n",

            "mentions-from-quran-hadith": "\n\nArabic Root:From the root kaf-ra-mim (\u0643 \u0631 \u0645), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to be noble, grand, high minded. To be generous, giving, beneficent, to be highly esteemed, honored, prized, valued, to be excellent, precious, valuable, rare, to be productive, fruitful.\nFirst Interpretation of the Name:The name Al-Kareem is understood to have two meanings. More commonly understood to be the one who is generous or bestows honor. But some scholars have said Al-Kareem also possesses the same quality of being all honorable or noble. This interpretation is supported by the idea that Karam (same root k-r-m) is used to describe something honored or respected. In the Qur'an, it says, \"Wa laqad karramnaa Baneee aadama,\" meaning, \"And We have certainly honored the children of Adam\" (Qur'an 17:70). This view also connects to the last name, Al-Jaleel (The Majestic). Al-Jaleel is the highest in rank, which makes Him Kareem - honored or highly esteemed.\nSecond Interpretation of the Name:Similarly, in the hadith literature, you will read Kareem to be translated as being noble. Abu Hurayra reported the Messenger of Allah \ufdfa as saying: \u0625\u0650\u0646\u0651\u064e \u0627\u0644\u0652\u0643\u064e\u0631\u0650\u064a\u0645\u064e \u0627\u0628\u0652\u0646\u064e \u0627\u0644\u0652\u0643\u064e\u0631\u0650\u064a\u0645\u0650 \u0627\u0628\u0652\u0646\u0650 \u0627\u0644\u0652\u0643\u064e\u0631\u0650\u064a\u0645\u0650 \u0627\u0628\u0652\u0646\u0650 \u0627\u0644\u0652\u0643\u064e\u0631\u0650\u064a\u0645\u0650 \u064a\u064f\u0648\u0633\u064f\u0641\u064f \u0628\u0652\u0646\u064f \u064a\u064e\u0639\u0652\u0642\u064f\u0648\u0628\u064e \u0628\u0652\u0646\u0650 \u0625\u0650\u0633\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0627\u0642\u064e \u0628\u0652\u0646\u0650 \u0625\u0650\u0628\u0652\u0631\u064e\u0627\u0647\u0650\u064a\u0645\u064e, \"The noble son of the noble son of the noble son of the noble one was Yusuf ibn Ya'qub ibn Ishaq ibn Ibrahim.\" [1] Note the repetition of the Arabic (\u0627\u0628\u0652\u0646\u0650 \u0627\u0644\u0652\u0643\u064e\u0631\u0650\u064a\u0645\u0650), Ibn Kareem, as being translated as \"The Noble Son.\" So together, we have the definition of being esteemed, noble, and honored. To have this reputation, to be called by these names indicates that you must have some virtuous qualities that have been perfected.\nAnother example, Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 in Surah Waqi'ah verse 77 says, Innahoo la quraanun kareem which translates to, \"Indeed, it is a noble Qur\u2019an.\" The connotation of Kareem being kind doesn't apply here because it's not clear what it means for a book to be gracious or generous. Instead, as the translation reflects, being a book of nobility does, meaning a book perfected in all its attributes.\nNow, moving towards the more understood meaning of this name. Kareem refers to kindness or generosity. His greatest gift to mankind is His mercy. We show a lapse in judgment whenever we err and should be held accountable for our actions.

The following verses speak to how He taught us all we know with a pen (i.e., through His book). This highlights the noblest attributes Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 has gifted mankind. It's distinguished us from all other creations and has given us success as a species. Without this ability to learn from the pen, we would remain stagnant unable to transmit knowledge from one generation to the next.\nThis brings weight to the saying that the pen is mightier than the sword. If we recognize this, being educated is just about one of the most dangerous pursuits. It's one of the greatest skills, the ability to learn, read, and acquire knowledge because, from that, we can pick up any other skill. This is one of the many gifts Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 has given humanity, hence the perfect pairing with the name Al-Kareem. The ability to learn and know is the process that lifts us from ignorance. It's process which we come to know who Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670. It orients and directs all who would take the time to read.\n\n\nSome of His Generosity Enumerated:Just as He is generous, He is also gracious, meaning kind and merciful. An example of His mercy, Allah has written down the good deeds and the bad ones. Then He explained it [by saying that] he who has intended a good deed and has not done it, Allah writes it down with Himself as a full good deed, but if he has intended it and has done it, Allah writes it down with Himself as from ten good deeds to seven hundred times or many times over. But if he has intended a bad deed and has not done it, Allah writes it down with Himself as a full good deed, but if he has intended it and has done it, Allah writes it down as one bad deed.[2]\nAnd in the Qur'an, it says He will give a \"noble reward,\" meaning a multiplicative reward to those who give from their wealth to help those less fortunate.\n \u0625\u0650\u0646\u0651\u064e \u0671\u0644\u06e1\u0645\u064f\u0635\u0651\u064e\u062f\u0651\u0650\u0642\u0650\u064a\u0646\u064e \u0648\u064e\u0671\u0644\u06e1\u0645\u064f\u0635\u0651\u064e\u062f\u0651\u0650\u0642\u064e\u0670\u062a\u0650 \u0648\u064e\u0623\u064e\u0642\u06e1\u0631\u064e\u0636\u064f\u0648\u0627\u0652 \u0671\u0644\u0644\u0651\u064e\u0647\u064e \u0642\u064e\u0631\u06e1\u0636\u064b\u0627 \u062d\u064e\u0633\u064e\u0646\u0657\u0627 \u064a\u064f\u0636\u064e\u0670\u0639\u064e\u0641\u064f \u0644\u064e\u0647\u064f\u0645\u06e1 \u0648\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0647\u064f\u0645\u06e1 \u0623\u064e\u062c\u06e1\u0631\u065e \u0643\u064e\u0631\u0650\u064a\u0645\u065e\nInnal mussaddiqeena wal mussaddiqaati wa aqradul laaha qardan hassanany yudaa\u2019afu lahum wa lahum ajrun kareem\nEnglish Translation:\"Indeed, the men who practice charity and the women who practice charity and [they who] have loaned Allah a goodly loan \u2013 it will be multiplied for them, and they will have a noble reward.\" \u2014 (Qur'an 57:18)\nThe scholars often list many other ways His generosity shines through. We enumerate some of the ways here:\n\nHe loves to give. Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 loves when His servant turns to Him to ask for something. And when He gives, He gives without any reluctance or measure.\nHe gives without asking and gives to whomever. We only see a few of these gifts as we've likely taken many of them for granted: our sight, intellect, health, friends, family, food, etc. It's often quoted, \"A healthy man wants a thousand things, a sick man only wants one.\"\nHe gives more than one can imagine. Out of all the blessings in your life, how many did you explicitly ask for?\nNo discrimination. He gives to sinners and non-believers as well. He grants them the chance to see and accept the truth, \"And whoever disbelieves - I will grant him enjoyment for a little; then I will force him to the punishment of the Fire, and wretched is the destination.\" (2:126)\nFulfills all promises and never turns His back on a supplicant. He does not reject an asker. Narrated Salman al-Farsi: The Prophet (\ufdfa) said: Your Lord is munificent and generous, and is ashamed to turn away empty the hands of His servant when he raises them to Him. [3]\nHe gives even to those He knows who are insincere. \"And when affliction touches man, he calls upon Us, whether lying on his side or sitting or standing; but when We remove from him his affliction, he continues [in disobedience] as if he had never called upon Us to [remove] an affliction that touched him. Thus is made pleasing to the transgressors that which they have been doing\" (10:12)\n\nReflection:A believer benefits from knowing that Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 is Al-Kareem. We recognize that our Lord is generous, bountiful, and kind. We can try our best to mimic some of the ways Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 has been generous with us. For example, to find joy in giving. We may know someone or may have felt this way before, but when they give, they do so reluctantly. There's an art to giving that needs to be mastered.\nImagine a scenario where you're getting a free shoe shine at the mall. You look down at the shoe and see the young boy just gave you one of the all-time greatest shines. And so now you decide to tip him. You look in your wallet and see a $1.00 coin or $5.00 bill. Which do you give? You feel a bit reluctant to pay $5.00 for a 5 minutes shine. As a personal rule, if two amounts cross your mind, go for the higher amount. Why? It will make all the difference in the world. If you give the boy $1.00, you start feeling bad. Every time you put on the shoes and recognize the shine, you'll say to yourself, I must be cheap. You don't want to go through the whole day with that on your mind.\nAnother way to try and to be generous is if you know someone who is in need, offer a helping hand and save them the dignity of asking. If you know of their financial situation, throw a lifeline before the storm ravages through. Try and offer help before the pain necessitates them to seek help.\nWe can also try to perfect our inner qualities to gain a reputation on earth as being noble. This includes working on perfecting attributes of graciousness, kindness, courage, intelligence, compassion, and communication. These are all skills that can be acquired but require a commitment to a lifelong journey of being a student studying, searching, and analyzing. As Imam al-Ghazali points out, it is good to recognize that these qualities may characterize us. Yet, we remain deficient by comparison with the one who is the superlative form, absolutely generous, all-wise, the oft-forgiving.\nReferences:\n[1] Sahih (Al-Albani) Al-Adab Al-Mufrad 896\n[2] Hadith #16, 40 Hadith Qudsi (As it was related in Sahih al-Bukhari 6491 and Sahih Muslim 131a)\n[3] Sahih (Al-Albani) Sunan Abi Dawud 1488\n\n\n",

To keep an eye on, detect, observe to be mindful of. To be a spy, scout, observer to regard, hold in consideration, and respect.\nThe Watchful:There are two connotations as to what it means for Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 to be the all-watchful.

Armed with this knowledge, we should be aware of ourselves, our actions, and our motives. It should inspire us to do what's right in all instances. To work diligently serving Allah's cause and seeking His approval. A constant reminder of Allah's ever-watchful nature. Living with this name at the forefront of our minds should make it easier to mitigate the evil temptations of shaitan and our ego - the two biggest enemies we face.

He has not created us aimlessly to wander and become preoccupied elsewhere. Imam al-Ghazali says of Ar-Raqeeb, \"is one who knows and protects.\" If we were aware of the constant surveillance or permanence of His gaze, we should feel safe and secure. But also, like a parent watching over a child, we should be very cautious to avoid approaching things that have been forbidden.\nThe Castle of Al-Marqab:In Northern Syria, there is a castle called \"Qalaat al-Marqab,\" which translates to \"Castle of the Watchtower.\" This castle was strategically built 1,180 ft above sea level to overlook the Mediterranean Sea. The word Marqab shares the same Arabic root, r-q-b. A Marqab refers to something tall, high above, and looked down upon. In this case, the castle is a high vantage point to protect from potential intruders or attacks.\n \u0645\u064e\u0627 \u0642\u064f\u0644\u06e1\u062a\u064f \u0644\u064e\u0647\u064f\u0645\u06e1 \u0625\u0650\u0644\u0651\u064e\u0627 \u0645\u064e\u0627\u0653 \u0623\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0631\u06e1\u062a\u064e\u0646\u0650\u064a \u0628\u0650\u0647\u0650\u06e6\u0653 \u0623\u064e\u0646\u0650 \u0671\u0639\u06e1\u0628\u064f\u062f\u064f\u0648\u0627\u0652 \u0671\u0644\u0644\u0651\u064e\u0647\u064e \u0631\u064e\u0628\u0651\u0650\u064a \u0648\u064e\u0631\u064e\u0628\u0651\u064e\u0643\u064f\u0645\u06e1\u06da \u0648\u064e\u0643\u064f\u0646\u062a\u064f \u0639\u064e\u0644\u064e\u064a\u06e1\u0647\u0650\u0645\u06e1 \u0634\u064e\u0647\u0650\u064a\u062f\u0657\u0627 \u0645\u0651\u064e\u0627 \u062f\u064f\u0645\u06e1\u062a\u064f \u0641\u0650\u064a\u0647\u0650\u0645\u06e1\u06d6 \u0641\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0645\u0651\u064e\u0627 \u062a\u064e\u0648\u064e\u0641\u0651\u064e\u064a\u06e1\u062a\u064e\u0646\u0650\u064a \u0643\u064f\u0646\u062a\u064e \u0623\u064e\u0646\u062a\u064e \u0671\u0644\u0631\u0651\u064e\u0642\u0650\u064a\u0628\u064e \u0639\u064e\u0644\u064e\u064a\u06e1\u0647\u0650\u0645\u06e1\u06da \u0648\u064e\u0623\u064e\u0646\u062a\u064e \u0639\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 \u0643\u064f\u0644\u0651\u0650 \u0634\u064e\u064a\u06e1\u0621\u0656 \u0634\u064e\u0647\u0650\u064a\u062f\u064c\nMaa qultu lahum illaa maaa amartanee bihee ani\u2019budul laaha Rabbeee wa Rabbakum; wa kuntu alaihim shaheedam maa dumtu feehim falammaa tawaffaitanee kunta Antar Raqeeba alaihim; wa Anta \u2018alaa kulli shai\u2019in Shaheed\nEnglish Translation:\"Never did I say to them aught except what You (Allah) did command me to say: \u2018Worship Allah, my Lord and your Lord.\u2019 And I was a witness over them while I dwelt amongst them, but when You took me up, You were the Watcher over them, and You are a Witness to all things.\" \u2014 (Qur'an 5:117)\n\n\nThe lesson from Prophet Isa (as):In this verse above, Jesus or Isa (as) describes how he was a witness to the people while he was among them. But when he was brought up from Earth to Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 there was no one to watch over His flock except Allah. Analogous to a shepherd, Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 provides food, drink, and shelter. He is the one who protects us from the harm of many dangers we're not even aware of. In the next verse, \"If You should punish them \u2013 indeed they are Your servants; but if You forgive them \u2013 indeed it is You who is the Exalted in Might, the Wise.\" (Qur'an 5:118) Sometimes sheep will go astray, but Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 provides the signs to be guided back to the straight path. He has all the power and every right to punish, He is the shepherd or master, and we are the sheep, yet Isa (as) says, \"but if You forgive them \u2013 indeed it is You who is the Exalted in Might, the Wise.\" Our misbehaving does not affect Him as He is \"Exalted in Might.\" His forgiveness is not a sign of weakness but a mark of His intelligence, wisdom, and kindness.\nReflection:In one hadith, it describes how the companions gathered around the Prophet \ufdfa and asked questions about Al-Imaan, Al-Islam, and Al-Ihsan. In the hadith, they discussed the obligations of Al-Imaan and affirmed Al-Qadr (the divine decree of Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670). It is quite a long hadith, but at one point, it was asked of Prophet \ufdfa \"Inform me about al-Ihsan (perfection or performance of good deeds). He \ufdfa said: That you worship Allah as if you are seeing Him, for though you don't see Him, He, verily, sees you. [1]\nA common thread that runs through each name requires us to look inward. The believer benefits from this self-monitoring, not just from doing immoral acts but asking if they are living up to their potential. Are they using their time in a manner that Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 would be pleased to see? By truly embracing this perspective, a person can become more aware of how they dispense with their time. A person looks to see how they can be more productive and contribute to the well-being of their community, family, or friends. However, we must learn to balance, to not live with guilt to take time to enjoy the many blessings Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 has provided for us as well. In Surah Ar-Rahman verse 13, \"So which of the favors of your Lord would you deny?\"\nImam al-Ghazali also warns, \"knowing that his own soul is an enemy to him, and that Satan is his enemy; and that both of them take the opportunity to prompt him to forgetfulness and disobedience.\" This is similar to the famous African proverb, \"if there is no enemy within, the enemy outside can do us no harm.\" Suppose we learn to understand the root of our desires, fears, and insecurities. In that case, we can neutralize the destructive ways they manifest. If we are watchful over ourselves, we can protect ourselves from many shortcomings.\nReferences:\n[1] Sahih Muslim 8a & Sahih al-Bukhari 50\n\n\n",

So let them respond to Me [by obedience] and believe in Me that they may be [rightly] guided.\" \u2014 (Qur'an 2:186)\nAnd from the hadith, it was narrated by Anas: \"The Prophet \ufdfa said, \"My Lord says, 'If My slave comes nearer to me for a span, I go nearer to him for a cubit; and if he comes nearer to Me for a cubit, I go nearer to him for the span of outstretched arms; and if he comes to Me walking, I go to him running.'\" [1]\n\n\nAddressing the concern of du'a not being responded to:The Prophets in Islam (may peace be upon them) were regular people like you and me, except we held them to a higher standard as they were impeccable in character. Despite their respected status in Islam, they suffered and endured a lot. Contrast this with when we make du'a, and it's not immediately fulfilled. We may grow impatient or falsely accept that we're not on good terms with our creator or that we're being punished. Yet in the Qur'an, we are told Prophet Nuh (as) made du'as asking for the protection of his wife and son, yet when the tide came, it drowned his family because they were of the deniers (see 11:42-47).\nProphet Yusuf (as) was an innocent child. Do you think he deserved to be thrown into a well by his own brothers and left to die? Prophet Yaqub (as), the father of Yusuf (as), was deeply hurt by the loss of his child. Don't you think he prayed to Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 every day, asking for the safe return of his child? Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 tells us \"give good tidings to the patient\" (Qur'an 2:155). We know Yaqub (as) du'a was answered as he was reunited with his son. However, this was only after decades of so-called \"unanswered prayers.\"\nReflection:In learning the attributes of Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 we come to understand whatever Allah does, He does good. We may see the challenges we're currently facing as difficult. Still, there is a reward for going through the pain and struggle and remembering Allah through it all. The bigger the hill, the better the reward. And each hill trekked and conquered brings one step closer to Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670. If we recognize this, whatever obstacle is placed on that path, we will find a way to overcome it. This is similar to how a farmer must be patient to get his crop. He has to labor away many hours working under the hot, dry sun. He has to care for and nurture his garden to eventually reap the reward of his crops. No one said attaining the goal would be easy. But if we change our definition of what easy means to something you can do, then it's easy, \"Allah does not charge a soul except [with that within] its capacity. It will have [the consequence of] what [good] it has gained, and it will bear [the consequence of] what [evil] it has earned.\" (Qur'an 2:286). We trust Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 knows what's best for us as we keep relentlessly marching forward. We turn to Allah, asking for His approval and seeking His guidance, \"If Allah should aid you, no one can overcome you; but if He should forsake you, who is there that can aid you after Him? And upon Allah let the believers rely.\" (Qur'an 3:160)\nAbu Hurairah narrated that: The Prophet said: \"One of you will be responded to, so long as he is not hasty, saying: 'I supplicated, and I was not responded to.' [2] Be persistent and do not lose hope. One of the beneficial remedies is persisting in your du'a. Umar Ibn Khattab (ra) said: \"I do not concern myself with the response, but I concern myself with making supplication, for I know that the response will come with it!\"\nThe believer further benefits from knowing Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 is Al-Mujeeb. Just as Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 is responsive to us, we should be responsive to Him. He has asked us to uphold many values, i.e., of kinship, salah, spreading peace, helping the community, and keeping the sawm (fast). The Qur'an tells us (if we're capable) to respond to the ones who ask for help, \"and do not chide the one who asks for help;\" (Qur'an 93:10). The Prophet \ufdfa also never denied an invitation of a person who wanted to help Him even if it seemed unappealing or in this case unappetizing, \"Narrated Abu Huraira: The Prophet \ufdfa said, \"I shall accept the invitation even if I were invited to a meal of a sheep's trotter [feet of sheep], and I shall accept the gift even if it was an arm or a trotter of a sheep.\" [3]\nReferences:\n[1] Sahih al-Bukhari 7536\n[2] Sahih Hadith, Jami At-Tirmidhi 3387\n[3] Sahih al-Bukhari 2568\n\n\n",

His mercy, knowledge, and power are infinite. It is the work of shaitan to make you believe that your plea for forgiveness will be rejected. The Qur'an and hadith affirm that our Lord is merciful. We may have done terrible things in the past. We may have repeated the same mistake to the point where it seems unredeemable.

This name furthers the perfection of all His attributes. They are all-encompassing and have no extent to which they can be depleted or diminished. Imam Ghazali writes, \"His knowledge be considered, the sea of things He knows has no shore; in fact the seas would be exhausted if they were ink for His words.\"\nThe believer benefits from knowing Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 is Al-Wasi in that they understand their Lord loves them. His mercy extends to all and knows no boundaries. It is all-encompassing and vast. This should bring great relief to the one who turns to Him, often asking for His forgiveness. It was narrated from Aisha (ra) that she said: \"Praise be to Allah Whose hearing encompasses all voices.[2] We also must look within ourselves; we are constrained and limited in many ways. Our intellect has boundaries, and our physical body has constraints, but can we say honestly we've stretched to see what's possible? Are we living close to these limits? Probably not. We are all likely to be living well beneath the potential Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 has made us capable of.

You can read about Al-Alim, which covers what it means to be The All-Knowledgable, and see how it connects with The All-Wise. Understanding this pairing helps us to see how Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 knowledge permeates every aspect of our lives. Everything He's forbidden is not without reason. Allah's wisdom lives in you. Every cell is perfectly portioned to serve its purpose. The perfect cooperation of all the cells working together until the time He has called you to return to Him.\nOne of the best stories which illustrates how Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 is Al-Hakeem is through the story of Yusuf (as). We provide a brief write-up for those unfamiliar, but it is told in a manner to cover the critical life events. We recommended reading Surah Yusuf with translation to get all the details of this fascinating story.\nSummary of the story of Prophet Yusuf (as):When Yusuf (as) was a child, he had a special relationship with his father, Yaqub (as). He told his father about a dream he had, \"O my father, indeed I have seen [in a dream] eleven stars and the sun and the moon; I saw them prostrating to me.\" (Qur'an 12:4). Not knowing how or when, but he knew this vision was from Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670. The other brothers grew envious of their relationship and plotted against Yusuf. One day Yusuf (as) went to play with his brothers, and they led him to a well. When he came close, they pushed him in and abandoned him.\nThis set off a series of unfortunate events for Yusuf (as). A caravan of travelers stopped by the well and found the young boy. They pulled him out and rescued him but decided to pawn him off as a slave to a man named Aziz, the chief minister. Aziz treated Yusuf (as) well, and he remained loyal to Aziz, but Yusuf (as) had to grow up not knowing his family. Yusuf (as) matured into an intelligent, charming, and handsome man under the care of Aziz. Much is written about Yusuf (as) beauty, Prophet \ufdfa mentions in Isra' and Mi'raj he met Yusuf (as) and Yusuf (as) had been given half of (world) beauty. [1]\nThe story then takes yet another turn; Aziz's wife becomes infatuated with Yusuf (as) and seeks to seduce him, but he rejects her advances, \"[I seek] the refuge of Allah. Indeed, he is my master, who has made good my residence. Indeed, wrongdoers will not succeed.\" (Qur'an 12:23) Hurt and embarrassed by the rejection, she tried to falsely accuse Yusuf (as) for approaching her, \"And they both raced to the door, and she tore his shirt from the back, and they found her husband at the door. She said, \"What is the recompense of one who intended evil for your wife but that he be imprisoned or a painful punishment?\" (Qur'an 12:25) Yusuf (as) denied this accusation, \"It was she who sought to seduce me.\" (Qur'an 12:26). In the end, Yusuf (as) was found innocent since the shirt was ripped from the back, not the front, which was a sign of escape, not assault. Still, to safeguard Zulaikha (Aziz's wife) and protect her honor, Yusuf was sentenced by Aziz to prison despite being innocent.\nThe next phase of his life was serving time in prison. While in prison, he developed a reputation for accurately interpreting dreams. One of Yusuf (as) former prison inmates, who was freed and served wine to the King, knew of this skill. So, when he heard the King was having trouble understanding a recurring dream, he advised the King to meet with Yusuf (as) was called upon.

And he said, \u201cO my father, this is the explanation of my vision of before. My Lord has made it reality. And He was certainly good to me when He took me out of prison and brought you [here] from bedouin life after Satan had induced [estrangement] between me and my brothers. Indeed, my Lord is Subtle in what He wills. Indeed, it is He who is the Knowing, the Wise.\" \u2014 (Qur'an 12:100)\n\n\nReflection:The lesson from the story - Yusuf's life was overcoming one obstacle after another. When there seemed to be light at the end of the tunnel, he realized it was just an oncoming train. Yet, with everything that happened, he takes it in stride. He tackles each situation with resolve and never loses hope or faith. Why? He believed in Allah's attribute of being Al-Hakeem, trusting He knows what to do and with whom.\nWhen we read about the story of Yusuf (as), we learn a crucial life lesson that it's impossible to connect the dots looking forwards. We can only connect them by looking backward. We see how Yusuf (as) endured all the pain to end up where he did. In the end, Yusuf (as) saved the people of Egypt from famine, attained immense success, and was reunited with his family. Ultimately the vision he had in his childhood came true. It was not easy, and he kept in pursuit; he believed in Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 and knew the dots would somehow connect in the future but never exactly knew how.\nThis also brings about another question, if we could rewind the clock, should we tell Yusuf (as) not to play with his brothers that day? We know the answer is no, but we may still be reserved in our answer, not feeling one hundred percent confident. Our mind thinks maybe his life could've been better. Perhaps a route to the same destination with less pain? Even in our lives, we may wish things in our past may have gone differently. This goes to the idea that we will always wish for things to be better. We rarely embrace and accept reality as it is, even though it can't be any other way. But to the one who sees Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 as Al-Hakeem, they will recognize how all things are interconnected.

If you ask a happily married couple, what's the most important truth to the success of your relationship? What's the secret sauce? The resounding answer is often trust or honesty in the relationship. They will say that once that trust is broken, it's near impossible to repair. It's like broken glass, it can be pieced back together, but you can still see all cracks.\nAllah's forgiveness is vast:Allah's forgiveness is full. When He forgives, He does not require anything in return. We learn from these two ayat that we're always able to receive His affection. Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 does not like to see His servant punished; rather, He loves to forgive, and He loves those He forgave. There is no wickedness, malice, or injustice. Everything done is within reason - even then, He is on the side of leniency to the one who returns to the straight path and is sincere in forgiveness, \"Say, 'O My servants who have transgressed against themselves [by sinning], do not despair of the mercy of Allah. Indeed, Allah forgives all sins. Indeed, it is He who is the Forgiving, the Merciful.'\" (Qur'an 39:53)\n\n\nBeloved Actions:Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 has provided us with many avenues to garner His love and affection; throughout this guide of the 99 names of Allah, we've covered many actions that are beloved by Him, but we'll include a few here:\n\nHe loves all those who try, \"Allah loves those who are constantly repentant and loves those who purify themselves.\" (Qur'an 2:222)\nHe loves those who follow the Prophet \ufdfa: \"Say, [O Muhammad], \u201cIf you should love Allah, then follow me, [so] Allah will love you and forgive you your sins. And Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.\" (Qur'an 3:31)\nTwo traits in you that Allah loves are (1) forbearance (meaning self-control/discipline) and (2) deliberateness.[1]\nLove for the Prophet \ufdfa family and love for those appreciative of their current blessings. Narrated Ibn 'Abbas: that the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said: \"Love Allah for what He nourishes you with of His Blessings, love me due to the love of Allah, and love the people of my house due to the love of me.\" [2]\nLove for gentleness.\nIt was narrated from Abu Hurairah that the Messenger of Allah \ufdfa said: \"Allah is Gentle and loves gentleness, and He grants reward for it that He does not grant for harshness.\"[3]\n\nMany of the lessons from the ninety-names of Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 are a reminder of characteristics we know we should live up to.

We recognize that we have a Lord who is all-loving, caring, and compassionate. There is not a single person on earth who's beyond receiving His love or forgiveness. It is a name that should inspire hope in the believer and quiet your concerns or doubt.

Then he makes an announcement in the heaven saying: Allah loves so and so and you also love him, and then the inhabitants of the Heaven (the Angels) also begin to love him and then there is conferred honour upon him in the earth; and when Allah is angry with any servant He calls Gabriel and says: I am angry with such and such and you also become angry with him, and then Gabriel also becomes angry and then makes an announcement amongst the inhabitants of heaven: Verily Allah is angry with so-and-so, so you also become angry with him, and thus they also become angry with him. Then he becomes the object of wrath on the earth also.[4]\nReferences:\n[1] Sahih (Darussalam) Jami at-Tirmidhi 2011\n[2] Hasan (Darussalam) Jami` at-Tirmidhi 3789\n[3] Sahih (Al-Albani) Sunan Abi Dawud 4807\n[4] Sahih Muslim 2637a\n\n\n",

His excellence is unparalleled as it does not resemble anything else. It is unique and alone. To be all-glorious is not a single standalone attribute but the quality of perfection of several attributes together (similar to how we discuss in the name Al-Jaleel - The Majestic One). Imam Al-Ghazali writes, \"Al-Majid the All-Glorious is one who is noble in essence, beautiful in actions, and bountiful in gifts and in favours.\" In Ahmad Zarruq's book The Loftiest Goal in Elucidating Allah's Most Beautiful Names, he writes, \"Al-Maj\u012bd comes from al-majd, namely, the furthermost limit of nobility which allows for no additional increase of such quality beyond it, since it is complete in itself and outwardly manifest.\"\nIn the Qur'an, it refers to Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 as Al-Majeed once, and it is beautifully paired with the name Al-Hamid (\"The Praiseworthy\").

Rather, they are alive with their Lord, receiving provision,\" \u2014 (Qur'an 3:169)\nReflection:Most of humanity understands that death is an inevitability. They know of it, but they do not really understand it. They treat death as non-existence, the end of the road, or finality. But the believer understands that death is just act one scene one of this play. In the next scene, we will be brought back and held accountable for all that transpired. We will be held responsible for our actions. This should not be a scary proposition. Rather we should be joyful about this revelation. It brings purpose and meaning to our existence, \"Then did you think that We created you uselessly and that to Us you would not be returned?\" (Qur'an 23:115) So the one who understands the name Al-Ba'ith develops greater certainity in the day of resurrection and greater conviction in Allah's \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 promise.\nThe name also creates a sense of responsibility within, a duty to ourselves to become better and avoid being a degenerate (i.e., a person with loose morals, corrupt, or showing signs of decline). It was narrated that Aishah said: \"The Messenger of Allah \ufdfa said to me: 'O 'Aishah, beware of (evil) deeds that are regarded as insignificant, for they have a pursuer from Allah. (i.e. accountability).\"  [1]\nThe realization of death also brings about a sense of urgency. We have, but a limited time on earth, so we should not squander it. It should inspire us to do good and rush to acts loved by Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670. However you die here is how you will be brought back to life there, so seek good, and you will receive good. Death also brings to the surface the importance of moment-to-moment awareness, like a soldier about to be deployed overseas. They don't have any time to waste on trivial matters or petty arguments. They let all these things go, which tells you something about their importance. You can even imagine the week leading up to his deployment; he will handle all his affairs and be extremely loving and present. Why wait until the last second on our deathbeds to feel this way? Why wait before we're deployed and uncertain of the future? Is it because maybe we're taking tomorrow for granted? At any moment, we have the power to reflect on the name Al-Ba'ith and tap into the truth Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 has created this universe as a temporary place. Death is the inescapable reality we will all face. As mentioned in Surah Baqarah, \"Indeed we belong to Allah, and indeed to Him we will return.\" (Qur'an 2:156)\nIn many places of the Qur'an, Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 has referred to as knowledge (ilm) as hayat life. The heart without knowledge (i.e., jahl or Ignorance) is death. So, you can revive yourself by pursuing knowledge and resurrect others by being generous with that information. Imam Ghazali mentions, \"Ignorance is the greatest death and knowledge the noblest life. [...] Whoever lifts another out of Ignorance to knowledge has already created him anew and revivified him to a blessed life.\" \nReferences:\n[1] Sahih (Darussalam) Sunan Ibn Majah 4243\n\n\n",

As we mentioned in previous names, it makes us cognizant of our actions. We will be held responsible on the day of judgment, so unattractive qualities within ourselves (e.g., envy, anger, pride, back-biting, etc.) should be conquered as these emotions work against you. This name also encourages humility, admitting mistakes, taking ownership over your actions, and seeking forgiveness from Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670. So on that day, these mistakes will already be wiped from your account.\nRemember Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 is enough for you as a witness. Whatever good you do, if no one sees or recognizes it, it doesn't matter as Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 sees all. Nothing goes unaccounted for. Having this knowledge allows a person to drop all forms of pettiness. Who cares if you did something good for someone and it wasn't reciprocated. You invited them to your wedding, but they didn't invite you. Allah is the witness, don't let others' lack of care affect the good you can do.\nReferences:\n[1] Sahih (Darussalam) Sunan An Nasai (632) and Sunan Ibn Majah (470) | The Messenger of Allah \ufdfa in the hadith said: Whoever performs Wudu and does it well, then says the shahadat.

Many think truth is science, but this is false. There is no objective truth in science. Rather science's whole objective is to disprove that which we currently know. Only in the failure to disprove do we develop some kind of understanding of what is \"true,\" i.e., until it is disproven. This is the scientific process. Its goal is not to provide conclusions but to provide a model of reality consistent with the collective observations of humanity sustained over time. Things that have been \"true\" for thousands of years are things that have been thoroughly tested and therefore earned a higher degree of trust. Even then, paradigm shifts exist. There was a time when the predominant view was that the Earth was flat and not round. At one point, diabetes patients were encouraged to eat sugar because it seemed their bodies were just good at removing sugar from their system. So to compensate, doctors suggested eating more sugar to make up for the loss. They only discovered this was not the case through trial and error. It's hard to know the things we don't know. Every generation should have fewer blindspots than the previous, so we can have more confidence now than at any time in the past.[1] But that's not to say blindspots don't or can't exist. What if the reality we know today is just an illusion? A limitation of our sensory organs or the first layer of a larger painting? We may never know whether our observations are real or just shadows of what is real. The Qur'an states, \"The life of this world is nothing but delusion\" (Qur'an 57:20). So we've come to the point where we must accept that we know close to nothing. It's freeing... we realize how little anybody knows, and that's a good place to start as it opens the door for humility and exposes us to the openness of all possibilities. The one and only absolue truth we can be sure of is la ilaha illallah muhammadur rasulullah, \"There is no deity but Allah. Prophet Muhammad \ufdfa is His messenger.\"\nAbu Hanifa and The Atheist:Ibn Abi al-'Izz reported: It is said that Abu Hanifa, may Allah have mercy on him, was approached by some philosophers who intended to discuss with him the oneness of Allah's Lordship. Abu Hanifa said, \"Before we discuss this question, tell me what you think about a boat in the Euphrates, which goes to shore, loads itself with food and other things, then returns, anchors and unloads all by itself, without anyone sailing or controlling it?\" They said, \"This is impossible.\" Abu Hanifa said, \"If it is impossible with a boat, then how is it possible for the world, in all its vastness, to move by itself?\" \nThe point Abu Hanifa makes is that underlying every assertion - the one who causes it to be is Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670.

            "mentions-from-quran-hadith": "\n\nArabic Root:From the root waw-kaf-lam (\u0648 \u0643 \u0644), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to appoint or entrust for the care or management of something, to have a commissioned agent, a guardian of one's interests, to rely upon, confide in, lean upon, submit to.\nWho can we trust?Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 is Al-Wakeel, the one to be entrusted with all of our affairs. This relationship is entirely voluntary; it is on the part of the believer to recognize that Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 is the authority we should trust. An authoritarian leader, a corrupt government, or an institution may try to make the people dependent on them to enforce being entrusted out of necessity. But the reality is they are deficient and clawing to hold onto power. They cannot fulfill the demands of all the people. They are limited in capacity and resources. Secondly, whether they realize it or not, their existence is finite. Only Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 existence is eternal. Therefore it would be wise for us to bring our affairs to the one who can act on them long after we're gone. Only Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 has that kind of power, longevity, and capacity. He is the only deity deserving of having all matters entrusted to Him.\nSheikh Tosun Bayrak mentions of this name, \"He completes the work left to Him without leaving anything undone.\" People think of themselves as capable, but it is Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 who allows for everything. It's like if you were a duck floating in a pond while it's been raining, and you keep going up in the world. After some time, you think it's you and not the rain. You may say to yourself, \"I must be one good duck.\" Realize Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 gives people specific tests of wealth and poverty or success and failure. The question in each circumstance is how will they respond to these happenings? Who will they turn to help handle their affairs?\nImam Ghazali writes, \"But those so entrusted may be distinguished into one entrusted with some things (and that one is deficient) or one to whom everything is entrusted, and this is none but God - may He be praised and exalted.\" Only Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 is trustworthy, knowledgable, and has the complete power to protect and provide the best care for His servant. Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 is the all compassionate, the all powerful, the all wise. Allah is sufficient for you as a guardian, and belief and trust in this is the meaning of tawakkul. This does not excuse the need for one to provide for themselves, a true believer understands they must apply themselves to the best of their abilities. But it is Allah who decides to do what He wills and controls the outcome.\nHadith of the camel:This concept is beautifully illustrated in the famous hadith. Anas bin Malik narrated that a man said: \"O Messenger of Allah! Shall I tie it and rely (upon Allah), or leave it loose and rely (upon Allah)?\" He said: \"Tie it and rely (upon Allah).\" [1] There is no need to over complicate such a simple life philosophy. Complete trust and faithfulness in Allah's plan invite peace into your life. Worldly pursuit, ambitions, and not meeting your expectations cause misery and anxiety. Acceptance frees the mind from the prison it creates. \nSupplication of Prophet Muhammad \ufdfa:The name Al-Wakeel was also invoked in a du'a of Prophet Muhammad \ufdfa. He recited this du'a at a time of distress, at a time when he needed His Lord to help him overcome the adversity he faced. He suffered a great loss to Abu Sufyan in the battle of Uhud.

It refers to Allah's attribute of being strong. The one who has perfect power. He is eternal; death is not something that touches Him. From Ayatul Kursi, \"Neither drowsiness overtakes Him nor sleep.\" (Qur'an 2:255) No weakness or deficiencies reach Him. His strength is inexhaustible and overcomes all.\nHe is the most strong. To be strong is a broader concept than power or some manifestation of physical strength. In a sense it describes Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 entity as being perfected. He does not suffer from any weakness, whether it be His sight, hearing, judgment, or knowledge. He can provide whatever for whomever. With regard to His life, it is absolutely enduring forever. He is strong in all aspects - there are no exceptions.\nBecause of His perfect strength, we rely upon Him for our success alone. Given a choice between two leaders, you would likely choose the one whose power was unmatched (assuming they are not morally corrupt). Similarily, Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 has unlimited capacity and possess superior judgement. He is the only one who can provide the comfort and protection we seek. For this reason, this name is often mentioned in pairs with Al-Aziz (The Mighty) or Al-Matin (The Firm). Imam Al-Ghazali has noted, \"Strength indicates perfect power, while firmness indicates intensification of strength.\" Allah's decree is immovable.

He said: 'O 'Abdullah bin Qais! Shall I not tell you of a word which is one of the treasures of Paradise?' I said: 'Yes, O Messenger of Allah.'

The distinction is Al-Qawiyy refers to Allah's strength, He possesses perfect power. Al-Matin/Al-Mateen is an extension of His strength but focuses on its intensity. It refers to the quality of being solid, unwavering, and unshakable. When this name is paired with the name Ar-Razzaq, it means His provision is firm. Nothing disrupts its flow - no force can disrupt or weaken it. When paired with the name Al-Qawiyy, it means His strength is firm. Nothing can challenge or cause Him difficulty.

We recognize the importance of remaining firm in both the good and the bad. We must understand in life, we are either coming out of some difficulty or heading towards one. It's going to happen; life is a joyful experience mixed with some sadness. It's the way of life for everyone - to believe otherwise would be na\u00efve. We don't think anything can ever go wrong when things are going well. And when things are bad, we feel as though they will remain bad forever.\nWe must try our best to be firm in our patience and in our deen. Anas said, \"The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, most frequently said, \"O Allah, O Overturner of hearts, make my heart firm in Your deen.\"[1] Firmness in faith means flexibility with what Allah has planned for us. The trials of life are not unique to us; many have gone through something similar. Don't ask how to avoid the winters. That's not a possibility. Instead, we need to learn how to prepare and handle them. Some winters will be short, others will be long, and they will regularly come after fall. When it comes, remember firmness and resolve in Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670.

This was revelated concerning the torment in the grave. It will be said to him (the deceased: 'Who is your Lord?' and he will say: 'My Lord is Allah and my Prophet is Muhammad.

And My servant does not draw near to Me with anything more loved to Me than the religious duties I have obligated upon him. And My servant continues to draw near to me with nafil (supererogatory) deeds until I Love him. When I Love him, I am his hearing with which he hears, and his sight with which he sees, and his hand with which he strikes, and his foot with which he walks. Were he to ask [something] of Me, I would surely give it to him; and were he to seek refuge with Me, I would surely grant him refuge.\u2019\u201d [1]\nWe can read about who the awliyah of Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 are, but we should realize it's a status that is within our grasp. We should not read these stories without feeling inspired that it's possible for us. The Qur'an states by being a believer, you are a friend of His. The question then is how can one become the foremost elect of Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670. The answer is simple, but the practice is hard. It's to be dutiful and fulfill your obligations. To do good and obey His commands. Once that's established, go the extra mile and taste the sweetness in involuntary acts which are encouraged but not mandatory. Sheikh Tosun Bayrak writes, \"There is neither fear nor sadness for them (referring to the believer), for they do not know any other friend but Allah. They fear nothing except opposing Allah's pleasure.\"\n \u0671\u0644\u0644\u0651\u064e\u0647\u064f  \u0648\u064e\u0644\u0650\u064a\u0651\u064f  \u0671\u0644\u0651\u064e\u0630\u0650\u064a\u0646\u064e  \u0621\u064e\u0627\u0645\u064e\u0646\u064f\u0648\u0627\u0652  \u064a\u064f\u062e\u06e1\u0631\u0650\u062c\u064f\u0647\u064f\u0645  \u0645\u0651\u0650\u0646\u064e  \u0671\u0644\u0638\u0651\u064f\u0644\u064f\u0645\u064e\u0670\u062a\u0650  \u0625\u0650\u0644\u064e\u0649  \u0671\u0644\u0646\u0651\u064f\u0648\u0631\u0650\u06d6  \u0648\u064e\u0671\u0644\u0651\u064e\u0630\u0650\u064a\u0646\u064e  \u0643\u064e\u0641\u064e\u0631\u064f\u0648\u0653\u0627\u0652  \u0623\u064e\u0648\u06e1\u0644\u0650\u064a\u064e\u0627\u0653\u0624\u064f\u0647\u064f\u0645\u064f  \u0671\u0644\u0637\u0651\u064e\u0640\u0670\u063a\u064f\u0648\u062a\u064f  \u064a\u064f\u062e\u06e1\u0631\u0650\u062c\u064f\u0648\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u0645  \u0645\u0651\u0650\u0646\u064e  \u0671\u0644\u0646\u0651\u064f\u0648\u0631\u0650  \u0625\u0650\u0644\u064e\u0649  \u0671\u0644\u0638\u0651\u064f\u0644\u064f\u0645\u064e\u0670\u062a\u0650\u06d7  \u0623\u064f\u0648\u0652\u0644\u064e\u0640\u0670\u0653\u0626\u0650\u0643\u064e  \u0623\u064e\u0635\u06e1\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0628\u064f  \u0671\u0644\u0646\u0651\u064e\u0627\u0631\u0650\u06d6  \u0647\u064f\u0645\u06e1  \u0641\u0650\u064a\u0647\u064e\u0627  \u062e\u064e\u0670\u0644\u0650\u062f\u064f\u0648\u0646\u064e\nAllaahu waliyyul lazeena aamanoo yukhrijuhum minaz zulumaati ilan noori wallazeena kafarooo awliyaaa\u2019uhumut Taaghootu yukhrijoonahum minan noori ilaz zulumaat; ulaaa\u2019ika Ashaabun Naari hum feehaa khaalidoon (section 34)\nEnglish Translation:\"Allah is the ally of those who believe.

Both were separated from their parents early in their childhood. They faced harm from the people closest to them. Yusuf (as) brothers thought about killing him, and Abu Lahab opposed protecting his nephew and used to publicly humiliate him by casting rocks and leaving excrement at his door. Those closest to them failed to provide support. Aziz, who cared for Yusus (as), acted out in his self-interest betraying Yusuf, leading to his arrest and imprisonment. And how did they respond? They turned to Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670, the only true friend a person needs. Yusuf (as) made the du'a Anta waliyyee fid dunyaa, \"You are my protector in this world and in the Hereafter.\" (Qur'an 12:101) They are not hurt by anyone or anything because they have no expectations of others. They believe all matters are in Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 care. If you turn to Him in pleasing ways, He will grant you care and protection. It may not be as you want it to be, but trust Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 knows best.\nFor a second, imagine what it would feel like to be part of an inner circle of a kind King or someone of immense worldly success; you would be grateful for being in such a lucky position. You wouldn't want to break the trust and confidence that person has in you. Similarily, the believer benefits in knowing that Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 is Al-Wali.

Hence, He is the all-praiseworthy. We should feel the weight behind the words we speak. For example, in saying alhamdulillah, we recognize that He alone is worthy of all praise. Through our words and actions, we praise Him, and if we are mindful of the reason behind the words we say as we say them, we can't help but be overcome with gratitude.\nAl-Hameed is mentioned throughout the Qur'an 17 times, and we'll examine a few ayat to further understand this attribute.\n \u064a\u064e\u0640\u0670\u0653\u0623\u064e\u064a\u0651\u064f\u0647\u064e\u0627  \u0671\u0644\u0651\u064e\u0630\u0650\u064a\u0646\u064e  \u0621\u064e\u0627\u0645\u064e\u0646\u064f\u0648\u0653\u0627\u0652  \u0623\u064e\u0646\u0641\u0650\u0642\u064f\u0648\u0627\u0652  \u0645\u0650\u0646  \u0637\u064e\u064a\u0651\u0650\u0628\u064e\u0670\u062a\u0650  \u0645\u064e\u0627  \u0643\u064e\u0633\u064e\u0628\u06e1\u062a\u064f\u0645\u06e1  \u0648\u064e\u0645\u0650\u0645\u0651\u064e\u0627\u0653  \u0623\u064e\u062e\u06e1\u0631\u064e\u062c\u06e1\u0646\u064e\u0627  \u0644\u064e\u0643\u064f\u0645  \u0645\u0651\u0650\u0646\u064e  \u0671\u0644\u06e1\u0623\u064e\u0631\u06e1\u0636\u0650\u06d6  \u0648\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0627  \u062a\u064e\u064a\u064e\u0645\u0651\u064e\u0645\u064f\u0648\u0627\u0652  \u0671\u0644\u06e1\u062e\u064e\u0628\u0650\u064a\u062b\u064e  \u0645\u0650\u0646\u06e1\u0647\u064f  \u062a\u064f\u0646\u0641\u0650\u0642\u064f\u0648\u0646\u064e  \u0648\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0633\u06e1\u062a\u064f\u0645  \u0628\u0650\u0640\u0654\u064e\u0627\u062e\u0650\u0630\u0650\u064a\u0647\u0650  \u0625\u0650\u0644\u0651\u064e\u0627\u0653  \u0623\u064e\u0646  \u062a\u064f\u063a\u06e1\u0645\u0650\u0636\u064f\u0648\u0627\u0652  \u0641\u0650\u064a\u0647\u0650\u06da  \u0648\u064e\u0671\u0639\u06e1\u0644\u064e\u0645\u064f\u0648\u0653\u0627\u0652  \u0623\u064e\u0646\u0651\u064e  \u0671\u0644\u0644\u0651\u064e\u0647\u064e  \u063a\u064e\u0646\u0650\u064a\u0651\u064c  \u062d\u064e\u0645\u0650\u064a\u062f\u064c\nYaaa 'ayyuhal lazeena aamanooo anfiqoo min taiyibaati maa kasabtum wa mimmaaa akhrajna lakum minal ardi wa laa tayammamul khabeesa minhu tunfiqoona wa lastum bi aakhizeehi illaaa an tughmidoo feeh; wa'lamooo annal laaha Ghaniyyun Hameed\nEnglish Translation:\"O you who have believed, spend from the good things which you have earned and from that which We have produced for you from the earth.

It allows for a holistic understanding giving further insight into who Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 is. For example, we have Al-Ghaniyy (The Self-Sufficient - coupled 10 times), Al-Azeez (The Mighty one - 3 times), Al-Hakim, Al-Majid, and Al-Wali (The Wise, The Glorious, and The Patron - each paired 1 time).\nIn the previous verses, we see the pairing of Al-Ghaniyy (The Self-Sufficient One) with Al-Hameed. Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 would be worthy of praise even if no one existed. Imam al-Ghazali writes that Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 is \"Praised by the virtue of His praise of Himself from eternity.\" He is self-sufficient and free from the need of praise. We praise Him because we are in need. Ibn Arabi wrote in his book, \"He is His own praiser, the one who praises Himself [...] This is the height of generosity (karam): first, He gives you, and then He Praises you for what He has given you.\" This is analogous to how we often know the creator and praise them for their inventions. They are beloved and become heroes, idolized in pop-culture. But the true creator of the universe, the master inventor is Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670.

He \"sends down rain after they had despaired and spreads His mercy.\" In the ayah, rain is said as symbolic of nourishment or, as other commentators interpret it, spiritual or divine inspiration. We understand whatever is decreed by Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 there is wisdom in it. We may not understand it, and we don't necessarily need to. The veil may be lifted with the passage of time to see the blessings in some of our hardships. But regardless of what happens, remain dutiful to Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670, and be patient because whatever He has ordered will ultimately be for their benefit.\n\n\nDealing with a tragedy:The pairing of names helps us to see that Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 is Al-Hameed (worthy of praise) in all circumstances. That's why even in the darkest moments, we say alhamdulillah. One of the most painful experiences any human can go through is the loss of a child. Abu Musa Al-Ash'ari (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) said, \"When a servant's child dies, Allah, the Most High asks His angels, 'Have you taken out the life of the child of My servant?\" They reply in the affirmative. He then asks, 'Have you taken the fruit of his heart?' They reply in the affirmative. Thereupon he asks, 'What has My servant said?' They say: 'He has praised You and said: Inna lillahi wa inna ilaihi raji'un (We belong to Allah and to Him we shall be returned). Allah says: 'Build a house for My servant in Jannah and name it as Bait-ul-Hamd (the House of Praise).\"'[1]\nFrom the hadith, there is another story that exemplifies the best way a believer responds to tragedy. It is the story of Umm Sulaym (ra) and the loss of her child. She was one of the first Muslim women converts, and as we'll shortly see, she was a courageous, emotionally strong, and intelligent woman. She did things in a manner to please Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670.\nNarrated by Anas bin malik: Abu Talha had a child who was sick. [Abu Talhah was upset and distressed by the child's sickness.) Once, while Abu Talha was out, the child died. [Umm Sulaym (the mother) washed the child, enshrouded him and laid him down. She said to the people in the house, \u201cDo not tell his father that he died before I tell him.\u201d] When Abu Talha returned home [along with some of his friends from the mosque], he asked, \"How is my child\" Umm Sulaym replied, \"He is quieter than he has ever been.\" [Her husband took it to mean that the child's condition had improved.] [2]\nShe brought the meal, and they all ate dinner [then the guests left.] [She got up and put on perfume and adorned herself,] [making herself more beautiful than she ever had before.] He slept with her, and when he finished [they slept, and when it was morning, he did ghusl (full ablution) and was heading to leave, so she said to him] [\u201cO Abu Talhah, do you think that if some people lent something to some others, then they asked for it back, do they have the right not to give it back?\u201d He said, \u201cNo.\u201d] [They should return it to them] [She said, \u201cAllah Almighty, lent your son to you, and now He has taken him back, so seek reward with Him and have patience.\u201d] She said: \"Bury the child (as he's dead).\"\n[He became angry and said, \u201cYou left me until I did what I did, then you tell me that my son has died!\u201d] [Then he said, \u201cInnaa Lillaahi wa innaa ilayhi raaji'oon (Truly, to Allah we belong and truly, to Him we shall return) and praised Allah.] In the morning Abu Talha came to Allah's Messenger \ufdfa and told him about that. The Prophet \ufdfa said (to him), \"Did you sleep with your wife last night?\" Abu Talha said, \"Yes\". The Prophet \ufdfa said, \"O Allah! Bestow your blessing on them as regards that night of theirs.\" Umm Sulaym gave birth to a boy. Abu Talha told me to take care of the child till it was taken to the Prophet.\nThen Abu Talha took the child to the Prophet \ufdfa [he found him smearing some camels with tar to protect them from diseases, or marking them] and Umm Sulaym sent some dates along with the child. The Prophet \ufdfa took the child (on his lap) and asked if there was something with him. The people replied, \"Yes, a few dates.\" The Prophet took a date, chewed it, took some of it out of his mouth, put it into the child's mouth and did Tahnik for him with that, and named him 'Abdullah. [There was no young man better than him among al-Ansar]\nConnecting your salat with this name:When reciting durood ibrahim we call upon these two names, Al-Hameed and Al-Majeed. Narrated Ka`b bin Ujra: It was said, \"O Allah's Messenger \ufdfa We know how to greet you, but how to invoke Allah for you?\" The Prophet said, \"Say: Allahumma salli ala Muhammadin wa'ala `Ali Muhammaddin, kama sallaita 'ala all Ibrahim, innaka Hamidun Majid.\" Meaning: \"O Allah, send your grace, honour and mercy upon Muhammad and upon the family of Muhammad, as You sent Your grace, honour and mercy upon Ibrahim, You are indeed Praiseworthy, Most Glorious.\" [3]\nReflection:The believer benefits from knowing that Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 is Al-Hameed. If we introspect with this name, we ask ourselves how we can make ourselves worthy of praise - not in the sense of worship but admiration for our faith, character, or actions. What qualities must we possess to deserve respect from our peers, friends, or family?\nReferences:\n[1] Riyad as-Salihin 1395\n[2] Sahih Muslim 2144d & Sahih al-Bukhari 5470 | Combined narration from several sources, Bukhari, Muslim, al-Tayalisi, Musnad Ahmad, Sahih Ibn Haban\n[3] Sahih al-Bukhari 4797\n\n\n",

He qualifies as the praiseworthy one because of all His attributes and because He has given us what we have. He is the only one deserving in every manner of praise, and He should be exalted. Join in extolling him by repeating 'al-hamdu lillah, meaning 'praise be to Allah.'"

Of the 99 names, 81 are explicitly mentioned in the Qur'an. Therefore, you won't find Al-Muhsi recognized as an official name by certain scholars. This list includes Ibn Uthaymeen, Ibn Hazm, and Ibn Hajar, among others. However, others, such as Ibn Arabi, Imam al-Bayhaqi, and al-Ghazali, have included this name in their lists.\nAbu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (\ufdfa) as saying: There are ninety-nine names of Allah; he who commits them to memory would get into Paradise. Verily, Allah is Odd (He is one, and it is an odd number), and He loves odd numbers. And in the narration of Ibn Umar (the words are): \"He who enumerated them.\" [1] In the hadith, it uses the word with the same root (\u0623\u064e\u062d\u0652\u0635\u064e\u0627 - ihsa), meaning computation of some kind. To enumerate or to count.\nWhat is meant by referring to Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 as the all-enumerating, the numberer, or the counter? It is an attribute of His knowledge, much like Al-Alim (The All-Knowing), Ash-Shaheed (The Witness), or Al-Khabir (The All-Acquainted). The difference is Al-Muhsi is often described more analytically. He has knowledge of all things. He takes into account each separate item and stores it in His ledger. Every breath inhaled and exhaled, every leaf that falls, and the movement of every atom is accounted for. Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 knowledge is infinite, He knows a thing through and through. Some commentators mention He knows all the things that are possible, for everything that is possible. So, He not only knows everything but knows what it could have been. He's calculated the infinite possibility of every choice, and the downstream effects caused. There is nothing unknown to Him \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670.\n \u0644\u0650\u0651\u064a\u064e\u0639\u06e1\u0644\u064e\u0645\u064e \u0623\u064e\u0646 \u0642\u064e\u062f\u06e1 \u0623\u064e\u0628\u06e1\u0644\u064e\u063a\u064f\u0648\u0627\u0652 \u0631\u0650\u0633\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0670\u062a\u0650 \u0631\u064e\u0628\u0650\u0651\u0647\u0650\u0645\u06e1 \u0648\u064e\u0623\u064e\u062d\u064e\u0627\u0637\u064e \u0628\u0650\u0645\u064e\u0627 \u0644\u064e\u062f\u064e\u064a\u06e1\u0647\u0650\u0645\u06e1 \u0648\u064e\u0623\u064e\u062d\u06e1\u0635\u064e\u0649\u0670 \u0643\u064f\u0644\u064e\u0651 \u0634\u064e\u064a\u06e1\u0621\u064d \u0639\u064e\u062f\u064e\u062f\u064e\u06e2\u0627\nLiya'lama an qad ablaghoo risaalaati rabbihim wa ahaata bi maa ladaihim wa ahsaa kulla shai'in 'adada\nEnglish Translation:\"That he may know that they have conveyed the messages of their Lord; and He has encompassed whatever is with them and has enumerated all things in number.\" \u2014 (Qur'an 72:28)\n \u0648\u064e\u0643\u064f\u0644\u064e\u0651 \u0634\u064e\u064a\u06e1\u0621\u064d \u0623\u064e\u062d\u06e1\u0635\u064e\u064a\u06e1\u0646\u064e\u0670\u0647\u064f \u0643\u0650\u062a\u064e\u0670\u0628\u0657\u0627\nWa kulla shai-in ahsai naahu kitaa ba\nEnglish Translation:\"But all things We have enumerated in writing.\" \u2014 (Qur'an 78:29)\nCounter of deeds:\n \u0648\u064e\u0648\u064f\u0636\u0650\u0639\u064e \u0671\u0644\u06e1\u0643\u0650\u062a\u064e\u0670\u0628\u064f \u0641\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0631\u064e\u0649 \u0671\u0644\u06e1\u0645\u064f\u062c\u06e1\u0631\u0650\u0645\u0650\u064a\u0646\u064e \u0645\u064f\u0634\u06e1\u0641\u0650\u0642\u0650\u064a\u0646\u064e \u0645\u0650\u0645\u064e\u0651\u0627 \u0641\u0650\u064a\u0647\u0650 \u0648\u064e\u064a\u064e\u0642\u064f\u0648\u0644\u064f\u0648\u0646\u064e \u064a\u064e\u0670\u0648\u064e\u064a\u06e1\u0644\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0646\u064e\u0627 \u0645\u064e\u0627\u0644\u0650 \u0647\u064e\u0670\u0630\u064e\u0627 \u0671\u0644\u06e1\u0643\u0650\u062a\u064e\u0670\u0628\u0650 \u0644\u064e\u0627 \u064a\u064f\u063a\u064e\u0627\u062f\u0650\u0631\u064f \u0635\u064e\u063a\u0650\u064a\u0631\u064e\u0629\u0657 \u0648\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0627 \u0643\u064e\u0628\u0650\u064a\u0631\u064e\u0629\u064b \u0625\u0650\u0644\u064e\u0651\u0622 \u0623\u064e\u062d\u06e1\u0635\u064e\u0649\u0670\u0647\u064e\u0627\u06da \u0648\u064e\u0648\u064e\u062c\u064e\u062f\u064f\u0648\u0627\u0652 \u0645\u064e\u0627 \u0639\u064e\u0645\u0650\u0644\u064f\u0648\u0627\u0652 \u062d\u064e\u0627\u0636\u0650\u0631\u0657\u0627\u06d7 \u0648\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0627 \u064a\u064e\u0638\u06e1\u0644\u0650\u0645\u064f \u0631\u064e\u0628\u064f\u0651\u0643\u064e \u0623\u064e\u062d\u064e\u062f\u0657\u0627\nWa wudi'al kitaabu fataral mujrimeena mushfiqeena mimmaa feehi wa yaqooloona yaa wailatanaa maa lihaazal kitaabi laa yughaadiru saghee ratanw wa laa kabeeratan illaaa ahsaahaa; wa wajadoo maa 'amiloo haadiraa; wa laa yazlimu Rabbuka ahadaa (Section 6)\nEnglish Translation:\"And the record [of deeds] will be placed [open], and you will see the criminals fearful of that within it, and they will say, \"Oh, woe to us!

We all matter to Him, and He has accounted for us and guided us to live fruitful lives. He has not forgotten anyone. He knows everyone that has walked this earth - past and present.\nIn explaining each name, we try to find a way to connect the knowledge of the name to our everyday life. This often includes providing a reflection to consider how we can live and exemplify the same beautiful attributes to try and better ourselves. However, for the name Al-Muhsi, our access is limited. Awareness of this name is enough to have a meaningful impact in your life. Think of Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 when confronted with a decision and ask what you believe would be most pleasing to Him.\nAs a comparison to try and illustrate the scale at which Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 intimately knows every person, we examine our limited social networking abilities. It was proposed by an anthropologist named Robert Dunbar that the number of meaningful relationships we could make was capped by the size of our brain's neocortex size - that there's a natural limit to the number of friendships we could actively manage. His proposed number is coined as \"Dunbar's number\" and suggests we could hold about ~150 relationships (a meaningful relationship is informally defined as the number of people you would not feel awkward about joining for a coffee or some get-together). Now, every relationship is not made equal. Of these 150, only 5-10 may be your core support clique. You frequently interact, share bad news, and know what's happening in each other's lives. The second group may be 10 people you consider your close friends. The further out you go, the weaker the bond. Outside this 150+ boundary would be acquaintances - people you know but aren't in close contact with.\nNow, this number is disputed by some researchers - social sciences are not hard science. But the proposed number remains small (i.e., less than 400-500). Now, imagine the vastness and capability of Allah's knowledge when He tells us, \"And with Him are the keys of the unseen; none knows them except Him. And He knows what is on the land and in the sea. Not a leaf falls but that He knows it. And no grain is there within the darknesses of the earth and no moist or dry [thing] but that it is [written] in a clear record.\" (Qur'an 6:59) He not only knows each of us by name but remembers our prayers, our deeds, and what we conceal in our hearts. This is the vastness and complete knowledge of Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 and what is conveyed through the meaning of His name Al-Muhsi.\nReferences:\n[1] Sahih Muslim 2677a\n\n\n",

Of the 99 names, 81 are explicitly mentioned in the Qur'an. Therefore, there isn't one agreed-upon list for the remaining 18 names. Al-Mubdi is one of those names which is not included by certain scholars. This list includes Ibn Mandah, Ibn Hazm, and Ibn Hajar, among others. However, others, such as Ibn Arabi, Imam al-Bayhaqi, and al-Ghazali, have included this name in their lists.\nAll things have a beginning, except Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670. Allah is Al-Mubdi, the initiator. He is the one from which all things begin. This name is often mentioned in pairs, Al-Mubdi and Al-Mu'id (the restorer). The connection between the two names is the first creation represents the beginning, Al-Mubdi. There is nothing like it. It is unique and original. Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 creation is made from nothingness and without any model. When we build something, we're often taking inspiration or building on top of something that came before, that is said to be a restoration. The meaning of Al-Mu'id is the same, taking something prior and revitalizing it. Except for Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 can restore a thing from non-living back to life. We'll expand on the name Al-Mu'id in greater detail in the next section of the guide.\nThough the name Al-Mubdi is not mentioned in the Qur'an, many verses describe this quality of Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670. Instead, the Qur'an often mentions the two names in the verb form,  yub'di-u  (He originates) and  yu'idu  (regenerates).\n\n \u0623\u064e\u0648\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0645\u06e1 \u064a\u064e\u0631\u064e\u0648\u06e1\u0627\u0652 \u0643\u064e\u064a\u06e1\u0641\u064e \u064a\u064f\u0628\u06e1\u062f\u0650\u0626\u064f \u0671\u0644\u0644\u064e\u0651\u0647\u064f \u0671\u0644\u06e1\u062e\u064e\u0644\u06e1\u0642\u064e \u062b\u064f\u0645\u064e\u0651 \u064a\u064f\u0639\u0650\u064a\u062f\u064f\u0647\u064f\u06e5\u0653\u06da \u0625\u0650\u0646\u064e\u0651 \u0630\u064e\u0670\u0644\u0650\u0643\u064e \u0639\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0649 \u0671\u0644\u0644\u064e\u0651\u0647\u0650 \u064a\u064e\u0633\u0650\u064a\u0631\u065e\nAwa lam yaraw kaifa yubdi'ul laahul khalqa summa yu'eeduh; inna zaalika 'alal laahi yaseer\nEnglish Translation: \"Have they not considered how Allah begins creation and then repeats it?

It is a reminder to the one who began everything. It is really easy to pass the time by being busy and going, going, going that we miss seeing the bigger picture. We see Allah's creation through the lens of permanence. We don't think about the fragility of life, and when we do, it's misinformed. We think He's created us on this planet, and when we die, we return to Him, the work of Al-Mubdi and Al-Mu'id. But in reality, in every moment, who is giving us existence? Do you drink from a magical elixir every morning that sustains you? The lifespan of a single skin cell. Its existence is short, lasting only two to four weeks. Every day we shed 50 million dead skin cells, which goes unnoticed. It is an illusion that these attributes of Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 only serve us twice, at birth and on the day of qiyamah. But the truth is in every moment, we are being originated and returning to Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670. This is the nature of Al-Mubdi and Al-Mu'id, who is continuously working.\nIt's important to give ourselves some space, a much-needed break to pause and reflect. Technology is supposed to serve, not enslave. We don't need to distract ourselves every moment; let boredom and silence fill some time. See the beauty in Allah's creation - there is much entertainment there.\nRespect the gift of this moment given to you by Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670. The choice is yours to squander it or make the deliberate effort to take the most from it - regardless of what is happening or has happened. Insha-Allah, when Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 restores us, we'll be able to say, look at all the good I've done, all the smiles on people's faces I left, the adherence to the guidance you've taught. That is what the \"good life\" looks like.\n\n\n\n",

Of the 99 names, 81 are explicitly mentioned in the Qur'an. Therefore, there is not one agreed-upon list for the remaining 18 names. Al-Mu'id is one of those names which is not included by certain scholars. This list includes Ibn Mandah, Ibn Hazm, and Ibn Hajar, among others. However, others, such as Ibn Arabi, Imam al-Bayhaqi, and Al-Ghazali, have included this name in their lists. \nAl-Mubdi and Al'Mu'id:Al-Mu'id is often juxtaposed with the name Al-Mubdi (The Starter / The Originator). In this case, Al-Mu'id refers to the quality of Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 as being able to restore. He is the starting point from which all creation begins, and we will be restored to Him.

There is one additional comment that can be made here: a believer should think about life and death, but he/she shouldn't worry about it. The Prophet \ufdfa said,  \"None of you should wish for death because of a calamity befalling him; but if he has to wish for death, he should say: \"O Allah! Keep me alive as long as life is better for me, and let me die if death is better for me.'  [1] Of course, this is easier said than done.

Of the 99 names, 81 are explicitly mentioned in the Qur'an. Therefore, there is not one agreed-upon list for the remaining 18 names. Al-Muhyi is one of those names which is not included by certain scholars. This list includes Ibn al-Wazir, Ibn Hazm, and Ibn al-Uthaymeen, among others.

            "mentions-from-quran-hadith": "\n\nArabic Root:From the root mim-waw-ta (\u0645 \u0648 \u062a), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to die, pass away, burn out, be lifeless, to be quiet, still, calm, to be inanimate, to be deprived of sensation, to be spiritually dead, lacking spiritual life.\nAmong the disputed names:As we've mentioned prior, different scholars have different criteria for what qualifies as a name of Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670. Of the 99 names, 81 are explicitly mentioned in the Qur'an. Therefore, there is not one agreed-upon list for the remaining 18 names. Al-Mumeet is one of those names which is not included by certain scholars. This list includes Ibn al-Wazir, Ibn Hazm, and Ibn al-Uthaymeen, among others. However, others, such as Ibn Arabi, Imam al-Bayhaqi, and al-Ghazali, have included this name in their lists.\nThe pairing of Al-Muhyi and Al-Mumeet:The names Al-Muhyi and Al-Mumeet are often mentioned together for their contrasting nature. Al-Muhyi is the bestower of life, and Al-Mumeet is the bringer of death. These two attributes are not shared with anyone and are reserved for Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 alone.\nAl-Muhyi and Al-Mumeet are necessary as they bring balance to all things. If we lived as if we were immortal, we would be more likely overtaken by the temptations of this world with fear of no consequences. But the knowledge of our mortality softens many emotions and balances us out. We should have no reason to fear death; death is a gift to the believer. Because of this constraint, we rush to do good, seek Allah's forgiveness, and offer our daily prayers. The duality of life and death is created by Al-Muhyi and Al-Mumeet, which maintains this essential balance.\n \u0648\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0627 \u0671\u0644\u06e1\u062d\u064e\u064a\u064e\u0648\u0670\u0629\u064f \u0671\u0644\u062f\u0651\u064f\u0646\u06e1\u064a\u064e\u0627\u0653 \u0625\u0650\u0644\u0651\u064e\u0627 \u0644\u064e\u0639\u0650\u0628\u065e \u0648\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0647\u06e1\u0648\u065e\u06d6 \u0648\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0644\u062f\u0651\u064e\u0627\u0631\u064f \u0671\u0644\u06e1\u0623\u0653\u062e\u0650\u0631\u064e\u0629\u064f \u062e\u064e\u064a\u06e1\u0631\u065e \u0644\u0651\u0650\u0644\u0651\u064e\u0630\u0650\u064a\u0646\u064e \u064a\u064e\u062a\u0651\u064e\u0642\u064f\u0648\u0646\u064e\u06da \u0623\u064e\u0641\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0627 \u062a\u064e\u0639\u06e1\u0642\u0650\u0644\u064f\u0648\u0646\u064e\nWa mal hayaatud dunyaaa illaa la'ibunw wa lahwunw wa lad Daarul Aakhiratu khaiyrul lillazeena yattaqoon; afalaa ta'qiloon\nEnglish Translation:\"And the worldly life is not but amusement and diversion; but the home of the Hereafter is best for those who fear Allah, so will you not reason?\" \u2014 (Qur'an 6:32)\nDeath is not non-existence:These verses from the Qur'an do not include the name Al-Mumeet but help us understand the quality of being called the slayer. \"Abdallah b.

(i.e., death is the means by which he gains an introduction to the delights of paradise.)\" [1] Death is a state of being for living things. It does not mean non-existence or nothingness. It exists as another state from which our lives transcend. Some scholars have commented on how we live many lives. But they are all connected, one continuous life compartmentalized into distinct phases. We have the life of this world (hayat al dunya), life of the grave (hayat al qabr), life of the interworld (hayat al barzakh), the life of the day resurrection (hayat al qiyamah), and the final destination the life of the hereafter (hayat al akhirah).\n \u0648\u064e\u0644\u0650\u0643\u064f\u0644\u0651\u0650 \u0623\u064f\u0645\u0651\u064e\u0629\u064d \u0623\u064e\u062c\u064e\u0644\u065e\u06d6 \u0641\u064e\u0625\u0650\u0630\u064e\u0627 \u062c\u064e\u0627\u0653\u0621\u064e \u0623\u064e\u062c\u064e\u0644\u064f\u0647\u064f\u0645\u06e1 \u0644\u064e\u0627 \u064a\u064e\u0633\u06e1\u062a\u064e\u0623\u06e1\u062e\u0650\u0631\u064f\u0648\u0646\u064e \u0633\u064e\u0627\u0639\u064e\u0629\u0657 \u0648\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0627 \u064a\u064e\u0633\u06e1\u062a\u064e\u0642\u06e1\u062f\u0650\u0645\u064f\u0648\u0646\u064e\nWa likulli ummatin ajalun fa izaa jaaa'a ajaluhum laa yasta' khiroona saa'atanw wa laa yastaqdimoon\nEnglish Translation:\"And for every nation is a [specified] term.

            "mentions-from-quran-hadith": "\n\nArabic Root:From the root ha-ya-ya (\u062d \u064a \u064a), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to live, to be living, to become apparent, distinct, to animate, to revive, to vitalize, to call into being, to be whole, sound, to call, summon, invite, hasten.\nThree possible interpretations:As we discussed in the previous two names, Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 is Al-Muhyi meaning, the giver of life, and Al-Mumeet, the bringer of death. This name, Al-Hayy describes the quality of Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 as being ever-living. There is no beginning and end to His existence. Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 just is. There are many layers to the name Al-Hayy which we will explore in this section. (1) It Has already been mentioned and discussed extensively throughout the previous names; it's Allah's essence or quality of being everlasting. (2) The second layer is the perfection of His life. (3) The third quality is being the source of life.\nWhat is life?The word Hayy comes from hayaat which means life. One of the criteria of life as we know it is to have perception. Imam al-Ghazali says, \"The lowest level of perception involves the one perceiving being conscious of itself.\" Plants are said to be alive since they detect and orient themselves toward the sunlight. Living things are also defined by their ability to respond purposefully to what they perceive. But all living things are limited in their scope of activity and perception. We operate within narrowly defined limits set by the creator. And Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 in His infinite wisdom has given life to a diverse range of creations which vary in these two qualities of perception and activity. An example Shaykh Tosun Bayrak mentions is how a plant is superior to the soil or rock since it's given the faculties to eat, drink and propagate. Life in animals is more developed with hearing, seeing, and moving. And so naturally, animals learn to dominate over vegetation. Human life is said to be the highest form of Allah's creation. We can store what we perceive and use our intellect, reasoning, and free will to respond with this information. We can act consciously based on our knowledge. This quality seems to be lacking in animals who only respond to their desires and stimuli. People differ in their \"aliveness,\" which is often a function of their knowledge and actions.\nWhat it means for Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 to be living:Now, when the word hayy is used as a name of Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 it shows how He is aware of all things. Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 is the most perceptive. He is As-Sami (The All-Hearing) and Al-Baseer (The All-Seeing). There is nothing that escapes His knowledge as He is aware of all activity. In this sense, it can be said He is the absolutely living. This transcends all creation, not just in the sense of being everlasting, but in terms of what it means to be perfect in living. His life is perfection; it is not touched by sickness, weakness, or any deficiency. Absence does not precede Him, nor does death follow after Him. In Surah Baqarah verse 255 (Ayatul Kursi), Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 says:\n \u0671\u0644\u0644\u0651\u064e\u0647\u064f  \u0644\u064e\u0627\u0653  \u0625\u0650\u0644\u064e\u0670\u0647\u064e  \u0625\u0650\u0644\u0651\u064e\u0627  \u0647\u064f\u0648\u064e  \u0671\u0644\u06e1\u062d\u064e\u064a\u0651\u064f  \u0671\u0644\u06e1\u0642\u064e\u064a\u0651\u064f\u0648\u0645\u064f\u06da  \u0644\u064e\u0627  \u062a\u064e\u0623\u06e1\u062e\u064f\u0630\u064f\u0647\u064f\u06e5  \u0633\u0650\u0646\u064e\u0629\u065e  \u0648\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0627  \u0646\u064e\u0648\u06e1\u0645\u065e\u06da  \u0644\u0651\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5  \u0645\u064e\u0627  \u0641\u0650\u064a  \u0671\u0644\u0633\u0651\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0670\u0648\u064e\u0670\u062a\u0650  \u0648\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0627  \u0641\u0650\u064a  \u0671\u0644\u06e1\u0623\u064e\u0631\u06e1\u0636\u0650\u06d7  \u0645\u064e\u0646  \u0630\u064e\u0627  \u0671\u0644\u0651\u064e\u0630\u0650\u064a  \u064a\u064e\u0634\u06e1\u0641\u064e\u0639\u064f  \u0639\u0650\u0646\u062f\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5\u0653  \u0625\u0650\u0644\u0651\u064e\u0627  \u0628\u0650\u0625\u0650\u0630\u06e1\u0646\u0650\u0647\u0650\u06e6\u06da  \u064a\u064e\u0639\u06e1\u0644\u064e\u0645\u064f  \u0645\u064e\u0627  \u0628\u064e\u064a\u06e1\u0646\u064e  \u0623\u064e\u064a\u06e1\u062f\u0650\u064a\u0647\u0650\u0645\u06e1  \u0648\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0627  \u062e\u064e\u0644\u06e1\u0641\u064e\u0647\u064f\u0645\u06e1\u06d6  \u0648\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0627  \u064a\u064f\u062d\u0650\u064a\u0637\u064f\u0648\u0646\u064e  \u0628\u0650\u0634\u064e\u064a\u06e1\u0621\u0656  \u0645\u0651\u0650\u0646\u06e1  \u0639\u0650\u0644\u06e1\u0645\u0650\u0647\u0650\u06e6\u0653  \u0625\u0650\u0644\u0651\u064e\u0627  \u0628\u0650\u0645\u064e\u0627  \u0634\u064e\u0627\u0653\u0621\u064e\u06da  \u0648\u064e\u0633\u0650\u0639\u064e  \u0643\u064f\u0631\u06e1\u0633\u0650\u064a\u0651\u064f\u0647\u064f  \u0671\u0644\u0633\u0651\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0670\u0648\u064e\u0670\u062a\u0650  \u0648\u064e\u0671\u0644\u06e1\u0623\u064e\u0631\u06e1\u0636\u064e\u06d6  \u0648\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0627  \u064a\u064e\u0640\u0654\u064f\u0648\u062f\u064f\u0647\u064f\u06e5  \u062d\u0650\u0641\u06e1\u0638\u064f\u0647\u064f\u0645\u064e\u0627\u06da  \u0648\u064e\u0647\u064f\u0648\u064e  \u0671\u0644\u06e1\u0639\u064e\u0644\u0650\u064a\u0651\u064f  \u0671\u0644\u06e1\u0639\u064e\u0638\u0650\u064a\u0645\u064f\nAllahu laaa ilaaha illaa Huwal Haiyul Qaiyoom; laa taakhuzuhoo sinatunw wa laa nawm; lahoo maa fissamaawaati wa maa fil ard; man zal lazee yashfa\u2019u indahooo illaa bi-iznih; ya\u2019lamu maa baina aydeehim wa maa khalfahum wa laa yuheetoona bishai\u2019im min \u2018ilmihee illaa bimaa shaaa\u2019; wasi\u2019a Kursiyyuhus samaawaati wal arda wa laa Ya\u2019ooduhoo hifzuhumaa; wa Huwal Aliyyul \u2018Azeem\nEnglish Translation:\"Allah \u2013 there is no deity except Him, the Ever-Living, the Sustainer of [all] existence.

Narrated Anas ibn Malik: I was sitting with the Messenger of Allah \ufdfa and a man was offering prayer. He then made supplication: O Allah, I ask Thee by virtue of the fact that praise is due to Thee, there is no deity but Thou, Who showest favour and beneficence, the Originator of the Heavens and the earth, O Lord of Majesty and Splendour, O Living One (ya hayyu), O Eternal One (ya-qayyum). The Prophet \ufdfa then said: He has supplicated Allah using His Greatest Name, when supplicated by this name, He answers, and when asked by this name He gives.[2]\nIt is inferred from the last hadith that the greatest names of Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 may be Al-Hayy and Al-Qayyum. This is consistent with another narration by Al-Qasim, who said: The Greatest Name of Allah, if He is called by which He will respond, is in three Surah: Al-Baqarah, Al-Imran and Ta-Ha. (Hasan) Another chain for something similar from Al-Qasim, from Abu Umamah, from the Prophet (\ufdfa). [3] Al-Hayy and Al-Qayyum are both found in those surahs mentioned. There is another view that Allah may be the greatest name of all, and the case for that is because it is mentioned 2698 times throughout the Qur'an, way more than any other name.\nRegardless, it is not a worthwhile pursuit to view the names of Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 as being hierarchical and trying to determine their rank. Instead, we should follow the advice given in the Qur'an, \"And to Allah belong the best names, so invoke Him by them\" (Qur'an 7:180).\nSimilarly, we should try not to rank Allah's creation to feel superior. If Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 had given you the gift of knowledge like He had given Prophet Sulaiman (as) turn that awareness into gratitude and praise Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 that learning and studying comes easier to you than others. In the Qur'an, \"And We had certainly given to David and Solomon knowledge, and they said, 'Praise [is due] to Allah, who has favored us over many of His believing servants.'\" (Qur'an 27:15) We can't be particularly proud of gifts, they are from Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670. We should only be proud of the choices we make in how we use those gifts.\nThe main takeaway from the hadith is that invoking these names in our du'a can hold extra weight or reward for the believer. Especially when said in a time of distress when you need Him the most.\nLife after the death of Prophet Muhammad \ufdfa:There is an important message in the Qur'an and hadith. You can imagine after the death of Prophet Muhammad \ufdfa, some people whose faith hadn't been fully nourished yet felt disconnected. They listened to Prophet Muhammad for his leadership and guidance, and when he returned to Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 they felt lost. Surah al-Imran ayah 144 reminds all of us, \"Muhammad is not but a messenger. [Other] messengers have passed on before him. So if he was to die or be killed, would you turn back on your heels [to unbelief]?\" Abu Bakr (the first caliphate to succeed Prophet Muhammad \ufdfa) came to His funeral prayer\nNarrated Aisha (ra): Abu Bakr came riding his horse from his dwelling place in As-Sunh. He got down from it, entered the Mosque and did not speak with anybody till he came to me and went direct to the Prophet, who was covered with a marked blanket. Abu Bakr uncovered his face. He knelt down and kissed him and then started weeping and said, \"My father and my mother be sacrificed for you, O Allah's Prophet! Allah will not combine two deaths on you. You have died the death which was written for you.\" Narrated Abu Salama from Ibn Abbas: Abu Bakr came out and Umar, was addressing the people, and Abu Bakr told him to sit down but Umar refused. Abu Bakr again told him to sit down but Umar again refused. Then Abu Bakr recited the Tashah-hud (i.e. none has the right to be worshipped but Allah and Muhammad is Allah's Messenger \ufdfa and the people attended to Abu Bakr and left Umar. Abu Bakr said, \"Amma ba'du, whoever amongst you worshipped Muhammad, then Muhammad is dead, but whoever worshipped Allah, Allah is alive (Al-hayy) and will never die. [here ayah 3:144 was recited] (The narrator added, \"By Allah, it was as if the people never knew that Allah had revealed this verse before till Abu Bakr recited it and then whoever heard it, started reciting it.\") [4]\nThis can be a very instructive lesson for parents with children. In the same sense, they are guardians/leaders over their children, teaching them Islam just as the Prophet \ufdfa taught the sahabah. Sometimes children don't understand or become disconnected from the fact that worship is for Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 and not for seeking parental approval - or in some cases, avoiding parental punishment. Once the parent passes away or if the children grow up, get married and move away, they should remember that it is Al-Hayy, the ever-living, that they're seeking approval from.\nReflection:Many go through life at the whims of their impulses and desires. The one who is truly alive is the one who tames himself. His life belongs to himself, and he is not a slave to whatever the controlling force of the time may be. The truly living are the ones who are in constant remembrance of Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670. For them will be granted eternal paradise in the hereafter.\nReferences:\n[1] Hasan (Darussalam) Jami at-Tirmidhi 3524\n[2] Sahih (Al-Albani) Sunan Abi Dawud 1495\n[3] Hasan (Darussalam) Jami at-Tirmidhi 3524\n[4] Sahih al-Bukhari 1241\n\n\n",

This connotates a sense of dependence, He not only is self-sustaining but is the sustainer. For example, qa'im (\u0642\u0627\u064a\u0645) or qaimatun (\u0642\u064e\u0627\u0626\u0650\u0645\u064e\u0629\u064c) is an Arabic name/word for standing, rising, or being upright. Al-Qayyum is the more emphatic derivative containing the same root q-w-m. And in Surah Ar-Ra'd ayah 33 it mentions, Afaman Huwa qaaa'imun 'alaa kulli nafsim bimaa kasabat meaning, \"Is then He (Allah) Who takes charge (guards, maintains, provides, etc.) of every person and knows all that he has earned (like any other deities who know nothing)?\" Whether we realize it or not, we're all being upheld by the willingness and command of Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670. He is the maintainer who 'guards, protects, and provides.\nA man's duty:The word Qayoom also shares the same root of the word qawama, a concept of survival and subsistence. This topic has become controversial because it plays into gender politics. The verse which is viewed with scrutiny comes from Surah Nisa ayah 34, Arrijaalu qawwaamoona alan nisaaa'i bimaa fad dalallaahu ba'dahum 'alaa ba'dinw wa bimaaa anfaqoo min amwaalihim \"Men are in charge of women, because Allah hath made the one of them to excel the other, and because they spend of their property (for the support of women).\" Some translations of this verse use \"in charge,\" which seems more possessive but really it means a duty upon man to provide, protect, and look after the women in their lives. To be a guardian or a supporter. This includes, but is not limited to, material sustenance. But this sustenance can be further extended to emotional support, guidance, and companionship required for a healthy marriage. It's not to say women aren't capable, in studying seerah we know Khadija bint Khuwaylid (ra), the Prophet's \ufdfa first wife, was a very successful merchant on her own. Ibn Arabi says to assume this character trait, \"If one of the servants meets this condition in responding to the needs of the one who seeks his support, and if it comes frequently, he is self-existing.\"\nAnas bin Malik said: \"Whenever a matter would distress him, the Prophet (\ufdfa) would say: 'O Living, O Self-Sustaining Sustainer! In Your Mercy do I seek relief (Ya hayyu ya Qayyum, bi-rahmatika astaghith).'\u201d And with this chain, that he said: \"The Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) said: 'Be constant with: \"O Possessor of Majesty and Honor (Ya Dhal-Jalali wal-Ikram).'\" [1]\nThe believer benefits from knowing that Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 is Al-Hayy and Al-Qayyum.

No other is ever-living like Al-Hayy, and none is self-subsisting except Al-Qayyum. And so, as Imam Ghazali puts it, \"man's access to this attribute is in proportion to his detachment from everything that is not God the most high.\"\nAnas said, \"I was with the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, when a man made supplication, saying, 'O Originator of the heavens! O Living, Self-Subsistent! I ask of You.' He said, 'Do you know by what he has made supplication? By the One in whose hand my soul is, he has asked Allah by the Name that He answers when He is asked by it.\" [2]\nReferences:\n[1] Hasan (Darussalam) Jami at-Tirmidhi 3524\n[2] Sahih (Al-Albani) Al-Adab Al-Mufrad 705\n\n\n",

            "mentions-from-quran-hadith": "\n\nArabic Root:From the root waw-jim-dal (\u0648 \u062c \u062f), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to find, discover, attain what was sought, to become aware of something, to perceive, to experience, to gain or possess wealth, property, resources, to be rich, to have abundance, to be without wants.\nAmong the disputed names:For your notes, this is among the disputed names of Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670. There is no ayah in the Qur'an where this name is mentioned. However, as an attribute of Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 it is accepted and valid.\nTwo meanings of Al-Wajid:This name has two associated meanings, but they are connected. First, wajid (\u0648\u0627\u062c\u062f) is an Arabic word meaning \"to find.\" So naturally, the emphatic version of Al-Wajid as an attribute of Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 means \"The Finder.\" This speaks to the idea of Allah's resourcefulness in which there is no deficiency. He is not incapacitated in any way from what He directs His attention to. The idea is that whatever He seeks, He will find. Similar to kun fa-yakunu, \"Be, and it is.\" (36:82). He does not lack anything and is absolutely resourceful. This leads to the second meaning of the name, which is the realizer. The one who realizes (i.e., in the sense of gaining something), but also the one who knows the truth in all things.\nThe name Al-Wajid does not appear explicitly in the Qur'an, but many verses describe this quality or attribute of Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670.\n\n \u0648\u064e\u0648\u064e\u062c\u064e\u062f\u064e\u0643\u064e \u0636\u064e\u0627\u0653\u0644\u0651\u0657\u0627 \u0641\u064e\u0647\u064e\u062f\u064e\u0649\u0670\n \u0648\u064e\u0648\u064e\u062c\u064e\u062f\u064e\u0643\u064e \u0639\u064e\u0627\u0653\u0626\u0650\u0644\u0657\u0627 \u0641\u064e\u0623\u064e\u063a\u06e1\u0646\u064e\u0649\u0670\n\n97.

Not in a reclusive way, but completely selfless with an open hand to those who seek Him and ask for His help. He is full in every sense of that word; we should not fear turning to Him and asking for all that is good for us. Find sufficiency in Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 for what we seek in all matters is Him. This is unlike the condition that develops from dealing with people who require reciprocity (i.e., favors in return). We're incapable of giving as freely as Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 gives because we're limited, we have finite resources (both in time and money), and in giving we deplete one of these reserves. We can try to make ourselves more resourceful, but it will always be relative. We can never be the absolutely resourceful one.\nHow can we make ourselves more resourceful? It is not always about having more to give more - although that is one aspect of what it means to be resourceful. Resourcefulness can mean trying to accomplish more in less time, being innovative, or finding creative yet simple solutions to overlooked problems. It can also mean spending intelligently from our reserves so as to not be wasteful. If you found a way to buy a TV that was $1000 for $100, you might be very happy for being so resourceful. But the price is only one aspect of the purchase; the TV can cost you a lot in other ways, such as wasted time. This is often a very expensive part of the equation that's missing. If you spend 10 hours a week, that's 40 hours a month or a combined total of 480 hours a year! Imagine if you cut that viewing time in half or a third. You can measure to see if the quality of your life, mood, and happiness increases or decreases. Ask yourself open-ended questions and be curious, \"how could that time be better spent and what impact would that have in my life and for those around me?\" It's a question worth exploring, and each person's answer will be different. Sometimes, being resourceful can simply mean eliminating excess and needing less. Imam Zarruq, in his book the loftiest goal in elucidating Allah's most beautiful names, says, \"Fortifying the heart: That is granted to the one who recites it over every morsel of his food, and Allah knows best.\"\n\n\n\n",

And that's for a good reason. You may recognize the similarity between this name, Al-Majid (\u0671\u0644\u0652\u0645\u064e\u0627\u062c\u0650\u062f\u064f), and the 48th name, Al-Majeed (\u0671\u0644\u0652\u0645\u064e\u062c\u0650\u064a\u062f\u064f). Al-Majeed can be found in the Qur'an. However, Al-Majid as an official name is disputed by some scholars as it is only found in the hadith of Tirmidhi.\nThe names do share similar meanings but vary in their degree of intensity. The fa'eel pattern signals the same meaning with the addition of superlative intensification - grammatically used to describe a quality only Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 possesses. It is more emphatic and indicates perpetualness or permanence. We see this pattern in several of His names, Rahim and Raheem, majid and Majeed, Alim and Aleem, and Hakim and Hakeem.\nAmong the disputed names:The name Al-Majeed is mentioned once in the Qur'an, and the name Al-Majid isn't used. As we've discussed prior, of the 99 names, 81 are explicitly mentioned in the Qur'an. Therefore, there is not one agreed-upon list for the remaining 18 names. Al-Majid is one of those names which has been excluded by some scholars. This includes the likes of Ibn Uthaymeen, Ibn Hazm, and Ibn Hajar, among others. However, others such as Imam al-Ghazali and Ibn Arabi recognize this name in their books on the explanations of Al-Asmaul al-Husna.\nBelow you will find the ayah, which mentions the name Al-Majeed.

May the mercy of Allah and His blessings be upon you, people of the house. Indeed, He is Praiseworthy and Honorable.'\" \u2014 (Qur'an 11:73)\n\n\n\nThe only one worthy of praise:The base of the names Al-Majid and Al-Majeed contain the word majd (\u0645\u062c\u062f), which means glorify, honor, or praise. There are many ways to exalt Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670. The easiest may be through these three short-phrases, Subhanallah (glory be to Allah - glorification), Alhamdulilah (all praise is due to Allah - praise), and Allahu-Akbar (Allah is the greatest - praise and glorification). Being conscious whenever we have idle time to recite these three short phrases has extensive rewards.\nAs mentioned in the name Al-Majeed, to be considered glorious or magnificent is not a standalone attribute. It comes from the idea of having perfected all other qualities. And Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 is the superlative of every adjective imaginable. He is not just the merciful, but the most merciful; He is not just wise, but the all-wise. Whatever quality you can think of, knowledge, wealth, power, sight, living, creating - Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 is the greatest.

This is what characterizes our deen and differentiates Islam from other religions. That's why the first step to converting to Islam is to recite the shahada. We testify, la ilaha illa allah, \"there is no god but Allah\", muhammadur rasul-ullah, \"and Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah.\" This core belief is shared among all Muslims and is the first pillar of Islam. These two names of Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 further emphasize this idea of Allah's oneness.\nThe word Waahid in Arabic means 'one.' For example, someone who is Waheed uz-zaman is said to be a unique person of that era (time). So it's used in a relative sense, but as a name of Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 it is absolute. He is unique in all aspects, the only one who embodies perfection. He has no equal. Throughout our guide on the 99 Names of Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 we discuss and encourage ways in which we can share in the divine attributes, to be merciful, giving, caring, and a friend to others. But these are human characterizations. It's important to realize that no one comes close to sharing in His attributes or actions. He is alone and unique in His essence. As Imam Zarruq has said, \"He is One in His Attributes: He resembles nothing and nothing resembles Him.\"\nImam al-Ghazali also mentions how Al-Wahid refers to the one who can neither be divided nor duplicated. This quality of being indivisible also makes Him one since He's not separated into parts. For being separated into parts makes the previous part dependent on the other to be considered whole. And Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 is Al-Ghaniyy, The Self-Sufficient - free from dependence on anyone or anything.\n \u0642\u064f\u0644\u06e1 \u0645\u064e\u0646 \u0631\u0651\u064e\u0628\u0651\u064f \u0671\u0644\u0633\u0651\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0670\u0648\u064e\u0670\u062a\u0650 \u0648\u064e\u0671\u0644\u06e1\u0623\u064e\u0631\u06e1\u0636\u0650 \u0642\u064f\u0644\u0650 \u0671\u0644\u0644\u0651\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06da \u0642\u064f\u0644\u06e1 \u0623\u064e\u0641\u064e\u0671\u062a\u0651\u064e\u062e\u064e\u0630\u06e1\u062a\u064f\u0645 \u0645\u0651\u0650\u0646 \u062f\u064f\u0648\u0646\u0650\u0647\u0650\u06e6\u0653 \u0623\u064e\u0648\u06e1\u0644\u0650\u064a\u064e\u0627\u0653\u0621\u064e \u0644\u064e\u0627 \u064a\u064e\u0645\u06e1\u0644\u0650\u0643\u064f\u0648\u0646\u064e \u0644\u0650\u0623\u064e\u0646\u0641\u064f\u0633\u0650\u0647\u0650\u0645\u06e1 \u0646\u064e\u0641\u06e1\u0639\u0657\u0627 \u0648\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0627 \u0636\u064e\u0631\u0651\u0657\u0627\u06da \u0642\u064f\u0644\u06e1 \u0647\u064e\u0644\u06e1 \u064a\u064e\u0633\u06e1\u062a\u064e\u0648\u0650\u064a \u0671\u0644\u06e1\u0623\u064e\u0639\u06e1\u0645\u064e\u0649\u0670 \u0648\u064e\u0671\u0644\u06e1\u0628\u064e\u0635\u0650\u064a\u0631\u064f \u0623\u064e\u0645\u06e1 \u0647\u064e\u0644\u06e1 \u062a\u064e\u0633\u06e1\u062a\u064e\u0648\u0650\u064a \u0671\u0644\u0638\u0651\u064f\u0644\u064f\u0645\u064e\u0670\u062a\u064f \u0648\u064e\u0671\u0644\u0646\u0651\u064f\u0648\u0631\u064f\u06d7 \u0623\u064e\u0645\u06e1 \u062c\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0644\u064f\u0648\u0627\u0652 \u0644\u0650\u0644\u0651\u064e\u0647\u0650 \u0634\u064f\u0631\u064e\u0643\u064e\u0627\u0653\u0621\u064e \u062e\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0642\u064f\u0648\u0627\u0652 \u0643\u064e\u062e\u064e\u0644\u06e1\u0642\u0650\u0647\u0650\u06e6 \u0641\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0634\u064e\u0670\u0628\u064e\u0647\u064e \u0671\u0644\u06e1\u062e\u064e\u0644\u06e1\u0642\u064f \u0639\u064e\u0644\u064e\u064a\u06e1\u0647\u0650\u0645\u06e1\u06da \u0642\u064f\u0644\u0650 \u0671\u0644\u0644\u0651\u064e\u0647\u064f \u062e\u064e\u0670\u0644\u0650\u0642\u064f \u0643\u064f\u0644\u0651\u0650 \u0634\u064e\u064a\u06e1\u0621\u0656 \u0648\u064e\u0647\u064f\u0648\u064e \u0671\u0644\u06e1\u0648\u064e\u0670\u062d\u0650\u062f\u064f \u0671\u0644\u06e1\u0642\u064e\u0647\u0651\u064e\u0640\u0670\u0631\u064f\nQul mar Rabbus samaawaati wal ard; qulillaah; qul afattakhaztum min dooniheee awliyaaa'a laa yamlikoona li anfusihim naf'anw wa laa darraa; qul hal yastawil a'maa wal baseeru am hal tastawiz zulumaatu wannoor; am ja'aloo lillaahi shurakaaa'a khalaqoo kakhalqihee fatashaa bahal khalqu 'alaihim; qulil laahu Khaaliqu kulli shai'inw wa Huwal Waahidul Qahhar\nEnglish Translation:\"Say, 'Who is Lord of the heavens and earth?'

We see this with countries, governments, companies, tribes, sports teams, etc. As an individual climbs the ladder, they begin to take more control and serve as a leader to the surrounding people.

He is the one who can neither be divided nor duplicated, making Him the one and only. This is the starting point of what it means to be a Muslim, the core belief from which everything else stems. That is why in the shahadah, we testify, la ilaha illa allahem>, \"there is no god but Allah.\" He is said to be the one who existed before anything else existed. In this sense, He was the first. For a further explanation of His oneness, please view the section of Al-Wahid.\nIn this section, we explore the view of scholars explaining the difference between Al-Ahad and Al-Wahid, although both refer to His oneness. Each name of Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 is unique and offers a new shade of meaning. They are not synonymous, although there may be some overlap. Al-Ahad describes absolute oneness and uniqueness; none compares to Him. In contrast, Al-Wahid refers to His being as the numerical one. Some commentators noted that Al-Wahid indicates affirmation, whereas Al-Ahad refers to negation. For example, fi alhiqihi, lam ara ahada, \"Actually, I didn't see anyone,\" and yabqa rajulun wahidun, \"one man remains.\" Others note that Ahad is seen as conveying a higher degree. He is intensely one, uniquely one.\nThe name Al-Wahid is mentioned many times throughout the Qur'an. The name Al-Ahad appears in one place, and that is in Surah Ikhlas.\n \u0642\u064f\u0644\u06e1 \u0647\u064f\u0648\u064e \u0671\u0644\u0644\u0651\u064e\u0647\u064f \u0623\u064e\u062d\u064e\u062f\u064c\nQul huwal laahu ahad\nEnglish Translation:\"Say, \u201cHe is Allah, [who is] One,\" \u2014 (Qur'an 112:1)\n \u0648\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0645\u06e1 \u064a\u064e\u0643\u064f\u0646 \u0644\u0651\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0643\u064f\u0641\u064f\u0648\u064b\u0627 \u0623\u064e\u062d\u064e\u062f\u064f\u06e2\nWa lam yakul-lahoo kufuwan ahad (section 1)\nEnglish Translation:\"Nor is there to Him any equivalent.\" \u2014 (Qur'an 112:4)\nSa'\u012bd b. al-Musayyib reported in mursal form that the Prophet said, \"If anyone recites ten times 'Say, He is God, One', a palace will be built for him in paradise because of it; if anyone recites twenty times two palaces will be built for him in paradise because of it; and if anyone recites it thirty times three palaces will be built for him in paradise because of it.\" 'Umar b. al-Khatt\u0101b said, \"I swear by God, messenger of God, that we shall then produce many palaces for ourselves;\" to which he replied, \"God's abundant grace is even more comprehensive than that.\"  [1]\n\n\nThe Love For Surah Ikhlas:Anas said: One of the Ansar used to lead the Ansar in Salat in the Quba' mosque and it was his habit to recite Qul Huwal-lahu Ahad whenever he wanted to recite something in Salat. When he finished that Surah, he would recite another one with it. He followed the same procedure in each Rak'a. His companions discussed this with him and said, \"You recite this Surah and do not consider it sufficient and then you recite another. So would you recite it alone or leave it and recite some other.\"  He said, \"I will never leave it and if you want me to be your Imam on this condition then it is all right; otherwise I will leave you.\"  They knew that he was the best amongst them and they did not like someone else to lead them in Salat. When the Prophet \ufdfa went to them as usual, they informed him about it. The Prophet \ufdfa addressed him and said, \"O so-and-so, what forbids you from doing what your companions ask you to do? Why do you read this Surah particularly in every Rak'a?\" He repiled, \"I love this Surah.\" The Prophet \ufdfa said, \"Your love for this Surah will make you enter Paradise.\"  [2]\nAbu Darda reported Allah's Apostle \ufdfa as saying: Is any one of you incapable of reciting a third of the Qur'an in a night? They (the Companions) asked: How could one recite a third of the Qur'an (in a night)? Upon this he (the Holy Prophet \ufdfa) said:\" 'Say: He is Allah, One' (Qur'an 112) is equivalent to a third of the Qur'an.\"  [3]\nReflection:The believer benefits in knowing that Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 is Al-Ahad. We realize what it means to be truly unique. Allah is the one and only Creator (Al-Khaliq), the one and only Provider (Ar-Razzaq). As the title of the Surah Ikhlas (meaning 'sincerity') suggests, we turn to Him with the purest intentions to seek His mercy, love, and acceptance. We also learn of the extensive rewards that's gift-wrapped for the believer in reciting Surah Ikhlas.\nWe can reflect on this name by asking ourselves how we are unique. What admirable qualities do I possess or wish to develop? What are attributes honorable in the sight of Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 often neglected? It's easy to conform and blend in with the masses. In fact, we may unconsciously do this so as to not be ostracized from standing out. Instead, we should recognize how Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 made us unique and be grateful to Him. Don't fall for the dreams people sell that you should be like them, which can only be achieved by purchasing their product. This is a chase that will lead to unfulfillment.

It has the following classical Arabic connotations: to endeavor, to reach or attain something, to turn to, to need, to direct oneself toward, or aim toward something, to set up, to erect something, to be impenetrable, solid, to remain unaffected, unchanged, to be sublime, and everlasting.\nExploring multiple meanings of the name:There are several meanings of As-Samad. We've covered some of these aspects in the previous names, so less time will be spent here elaborating on those qualities. The first is the idea of self-sustaining, self-sufficiency, and being independent of all things (see also #63, Al-Qayyum). The name is mentioned in Surah Ikhlas shortly after being told that Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 is Al-Ahad (The Unique / The Sole One). These names come together to paint a picture that He is alone, indivisible, and unique. There is no deity outside of Him who we can sufficiently rely upon. The nature of creation is neediness, so we turn to the one absolutely free of needs and depend on no one else. He alone is enough for the believer. All our troubles, needs, and wants are handled perfectly in the care of Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670.\nAlso note, this name or attribute of being Samad is only applicable for Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670.\n\n \u0642\u064f\u0644\u0652 \u0647\u064f\u0648\u064e \u0671\u0644\u0644\u064e\u0651\u0647\u064f \u0623\u064e\u062d\u064e\u062f\u064c\n \u0671\u0644\u0644\u064e\u0651\u0647\u064f \u0671\u0644\u0635\u064e\u0651\u0645\u064e\u062f\u064f\n\n1. Qul huwal laahu ahad2. Allah hus-samad\nEnglish Translation: \"Say, \"He is Allah, [who is] One, Allah, the Eternal Refuge.\" \u2014 (Qur'an 112:1-2)\nThe other common interpretation of As-Samad is the master who has complete control.  \"Ibn Abbas, 'He is the Master Who is perfect in His sovereignty, the Most Noble Who is perfect in His nobility, the Most Magnificent Who is perfect in His magnificence, the Most Forbearing Who is perfect in His forbearance, the All-Knowing Who is perfect in His knowledge, and the Most Wise Who is perfect in His wisdom. He is the One Who is perfect in all aspects of nobility and authority. He is Allah, glory be unto Him. These attributes are not befitting anyone other than Him. He has no coequal and nothing is like Him. Glory be to Allah, the One, the Irresistible.'\"  [1]\nFrom The Study Qur'an , it mentions As-Samad \"lexical, non-theological meaning indicates something solid and impenetrable or simply 'not hollow.'\" It then describes theologically As-Samad as being interpreted by some as \"an allusion to the primary or initial cause of all things, an eternally self-sufficient, independent being who continues to exist after His creation has ceased to exist the one who has and always will be.\" \n\n\nSupplication from hadith with the name As-Samad:\nAbdullah bin Buraidah Al Aslami narrated from his father, who said: \"The Prophet \ufdfa heard a man supplicating, and he was saying:\n\n \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0651\u064e\u0647\u064f\u0645\u0651\u064e   \u0625\u0650\u0646\u0651\u0650\u064a   \u0623\u064e\u0633\u0652\u0623\u064e\u0644\u064f\u0643\u064e   \u0628\u0650\u0623\u064e\u0646\u0651\u0650\u064a   \u0623\u064e\u0634\u0652\u0647\u064e\u062f\u064f   \u0623\u064e\u0646\u0651\u064e\u0643\u064e   \u0623\u064e\u0646\u0652\u062a\u064e   \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0651\u064e\u0647\u064f   \u0644\u0627\u064e   \u0625\u0650\u0644\u064e\u0647\u064e   \u0625\u0650\u0644\u0627\u0651\u064e   \u0623\u064e\u0646\u0652\u062a\u064e   \u0627\u0644\u0623\u064e\u062d\u064e\u062f\u064f   \u0627\u0644\u0635\u0651\u064e\u0645\u064e\u062f\u064f   \u0627\u0644\u0651\u064e\u0630\u0650\u064a   \u0644\u064e\u0645\u0652   \u064a\u064e\u0644\u0650\u062f\u0652   \u0648\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0645\u0652   \u064a\u064f\u0648\u0644\u064e\u062f\u0652   \u0648\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0645\u0652   \u064a\u064e\u0643\u064f\u0646\u0652   \u0644\u064e\u0647\u064f   \u0643\u064f\u0641\u064f\u0648\u064b\u0627   \u0623\u064e\u062d\u064e\u062f\u064c\n\nAllahumma inni as'aluka bi ann\u012b ashhadu annaka antall\u0101h, la ilaha illa ant, al-ahadus-samad, alladhi lam yalid wa lam y\u016blad, wa lam yakun lahu kufuwan ahad\nEnglish Translation:\"O Allah, indeed, I ask you by my testifying that You are Allah, there is none worthy of worship except You, the One, As-Samad, the one who does not beget, nor was begotten, and there is none who is like Him.\"[2]\nHe said: \"So he said: 'By the One in Whose Hand is my soul, he has asked Allah by His Greatest Name, the one which if He is called upon by it, He responds, and when He is asked by it, He gives.'\"\nReflection:The believer benefits from knowing that Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 is As-Samad.

Ibn Abbas was privileged to be so young and to have accepted Islam so early. He had immediate access to the Prophet \ufdfa who would often give him advice. So one day, he was praying behind the Prophet \ufdfa, the Prophet \ufdfa turned to him told him the following. \" He said: 'O boy! I will teach you a statement: Be mindful of Allah and He will protect you. Be mindful of Allah and you will find Him before you. When you ask, ask Allah, and when you seek aid, seek Allah's aid. Know that if the entire creation were to gather together to do something to benefit you - you would never get any benefit except that Allah had written for you. And if they were to gather to do something to harm you - you would never be harmed except that Allah had written for you. The pens are lifted and the pages are dried.'\"  [3]\nFor all our needs, be it spiritual, physical, or material - the source is Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 who As-Samad, the eternal refuge. We should never feel as though we are asking for too much and limit our asking, this would be an insult to Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 who is Ar-Razzaq (The Provider). Any restriction you put in your du'a is a reflection of a self-imposed limitation of what you believe is possible for yourself. Thabit narrated from Anas, who said, \"The Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) said: 'Let one of you ask his Lord for his every need, even until he asks Him for the strap of his sandal when it breaks.'\"  [4]\nImam Zarruq writes of As-Samad as \"the one whom people direct themselves to in respect of needs to be provided for.\" So the anthropomorphic realization of this divine attribute would be to become a person who people can turn to for help. Other people need us just as we need them. Seek the pleasure of Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 by helping your fellow brother or sister. Be a source of comfort and assistance that benefits them.

The belief in this attribute also connects us to all the other names. Al-Qadir is the able one - this refers to His strength and ability to do as He pleases. Sometimes we may want a thing, but as time goes on, we lose faith, it seems too distant or impossible, and we ask of Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 less and less. This is wrong. We should continue to ask from Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 for as long as we're alive because only He can give it to us. Why would we stop? Prophet Ibrahim (as) was reportedly eighty-six years old when he was granted his first child. If a thing doesn't benefit you, then Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 may withhold it, and He knows best. But don't ever believe it's not within your fate because you don't know. Believing so becomes self-fulfilling as you'll ask less and not take the necessary action to receive His barakah (blessing). It's as if to say Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 can't or won't do this for me.\nThe best attitude for a believer is to say neither I can nor can't.

He does let his ego direct his action through the delusion of superiority and self-control. But the other extreme is the delusion of irresponsibility, that you're incapable of doing anything. Simply be a servant who serves his creator, his family, and his community and lives immensely thankful to His creator.

Zakariya (as) was Maryam (ra) sponsor and was married to her sister. He used to visit Maryam (ra) in her chambers quite often, and whenever He did, he was surprised by the provisions that seemed to multiply with each visit. Eventually, he just asked,\" 'O Mary, from where is this [coming] to you?' She said, 'It is from Allah. Indeed, Allah provides for whom He wills without account.'\" ( Qur'an 3:37). Right then Prophet Zakariya (as) made a du'a asking from Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 for a child.

We have to take some responsibility in our du'a. Otherwise, we may fall victim to the same tragedy that occurred on the battlefield. The loss of Uhud was due to impatience. They were not disciplined, lured by material wealth, and abandoned their stations. And so, just as Al-Qadir has the power to make them victorious, He also has the power to bring about their defeat. He can do anything He wishes. The implied lesson is if you make du'a for knowledge, Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 may give you the cognitive mental ability.

            "mentions-from-quran-hadith": "\n\nArabic Root:From the root qaf-dal-ra (\u0642 \u062f \u0631), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to measure something, know the measure of something, to distribute, allot or apportion the suitable measure to decree, to ordain, to decide a matter (as though measuring it to fit), to exercise thought in preparing something, to make use of reason, to intend or determine something, to have the power, to accomplish, to be rendered able, to be able to prevail, to be empowered.\nDifference between Al-Qadir and Al-Muqtadir:The names Al-Qadir (The All-Powerful) and Al-Muqtadir (The All-Determiner) both refer to Allah's attribute of possessing power or being capable. But as Imam al-Ghazali mentions, \"All-Determiner is more emphatic. Power is equivalent to the intention by which a thing comes into existence according to a determinate plan of will and knowledge, and in conformity with both of them.\"\nSo, both names establish Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 as having power, but Al-Muqtadir exercises His power over everything. The example al-Ghazali gives how Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 has determined a day for resurrection. In this sense, He's the All-Determiner, The Enforcer. But if He wished, he could bring about the day of judgment today - but He chooses not to. Everything is done according to His knowledge; the reason for not doing so is up to Him. He's fixed an appointed time, and nothing can resist His plan (similar to Al-Qahhar - the irresistible).\nPairing with the name Al-MalikCoupling of the name Al-Muqtadir with the name Al-Malik (The King):\n \u0641\u0650\u064a \u0645\u064e\u0642\u06e1\u0639\u064e\u062f\u0650 \u0635\u0650\u062f\u06e1\u0642\u064d \u0639\u0650\u0646\u062f\u064e \u0645\u064e\u0644\u0650\u064a\u0643\u0656 \u0645\u0651\u064f\u0642\u06e1\u062a\u064e\u062f\u0650\u0631\u0650\u06ed\nFee maq'adi sidqin 'inda Maleekin Muqtadir\nEnglish Translation: \"In a seat of honor near a Sovereign, Perfect in Ability.\" \u2014 (Qur'an 54:55)\nWhat has been said about the pairing of the names Al-Muqtadir and Al-Malik.

Any failure or success is believed by him to be attributed to him. This is a very unhealthy attitude and can be the root cause of many personal troubles, from extreme egotism to self-hatred and anxiety. There is still personal accountability and responsibility, no doubt. We quote the famous hadith which was mentioned previously; Anas bin Malik narrated that a man said: \"O Messenger of Allah! Shall I tie it and rely (upon Allah), or leave it loose and rely (upon Allah)?\" He said: \"Tie it and rely (upon Allah).\" [1]\nDo what is required and leave the rest up to Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670. If what you wished to achieve comes true, alhamdulillah, Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 has given you the power and allowed it to be. But if things don't go the way you imagined, say alhamdulillah for Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 knows best. \"For We do determine (according to need); for We are the best to determine (things)\" (Qur'an 77:23). Submit to Allah's will, become in love with it, and embrace it. This is the route for the one who wants to receive His love, blessings, and power.\nIt's important not to indulge in unnecessary self-criticism. There is a healthy form of guilt and an unhealthy form. A normal person may feel shame or embarrassed in failing an exam, but to what degree depends entirely on the circumstance. With the analogy of the camel, the question would be, do you sincerely believe you had done your part in preparation? Did you study, seek the help of teachers, assistants, tutors, or online videos? Did you do all that you could've done? If not, let this failure serve as feedback that leads to behavior change. Don't repeat the mistake of the past. If you are stressed, there's often an underlying cause; take the first step to address it because negligence would be from yourself.\nIn the story of Prophet Musa (as), when he tried to break up the fight, he had no intention of killing the man. As soon as he realizes that the man has died, he says, \"This is from the work of Satan. Indeed, he is a manifest, misleading enemy.\" He felt remorseful immediately and began praying to Allah, Rabbi innee zalamtu nafsee faghfir lee meaning, \"My Lord, indeed I have wronged myself, so forgive me.\" In the same ayah, we are told Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 responded to this call, \"and He forgave him. Indeed, He is the Forgiving, the Merciful.\" (Qur'an 28:18). From what we know of the story is Musa (as) did not dwell on this failure or mistake. He made sincere repentance, and the story continues. He forgave himself just as Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 had forgiven him. The only way to get rid of the skeletons in your closet is to pile so much good on top of it that it becomes hidden from view. Musa (as) shifted his focus from his dire state to seeking good that could be done in the name of Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670, Rabbi innee limaaa anzalta ilaiya min khairin faqeer, \"My Lord, indeed I am, for whatever good You would send down to me, in need.\" ( Qur'an 28:24)\nNow, if you can confidently say there is nothing more you could've done, then Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 knows best, and we can only connect the dots looking back.

Al-Muqqadim is The Promoter, or the one who brings forth, and the other is Al-Mu'akhkhir, The Postponer, or the one who pushes away.\nIn this section, we will focus on what it means to refer to Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 by the name called Al-Muqaddim, and in the next, we'll cover in more detail the name Al-Mu'akhkhir. But note they should not be separated and mentioned in pairs like Al-Qabid and Al-Basit.\nFirst Interpretation - The Promoter:The first meaning is the promoter. This interpretation is likened to the name Ar-Rafi (The Exalter, The Elevator). Imam al-Ghazali mentions that the one who is brought close to Him is promoted. They have been given guidance and shown mercy. This includes the angels, prophets, friends, and scholars. And so Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 'brings forth' some through worship and seeking His approval and guidance.\nSecond Interpretation - A discussion on free will:The second interpretation is that Al-Muqaddim is the one who expedites. This discussion leads us down the path of free will and fate, which understandably can be confusing, and we'll try our best to clarify.\nAs the name pertains, He can make something happen sooner and be accomplished more quickly. For example, we know Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 has proportioned our rizq for us as \"(inscribed) in Al-Lauh Al-Mahfuz (The Preserved Tablet)\" (Qur'an 85:22). But from our perspective, through du'a and other actions which are beloved to Him, we can have our rizq expedited and increased. But from Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 perspective, there has been no change in the prescribed tablet. Our total rizq was decreed just as the du'a we made was known to Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 before we made it. But from our vantage point, it seems as though it was expedited. Remember Allah's \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 existence is not linear. He is not bounded by time like we are.\nNarrated by Abdullah bin Mus'ud: Allah's Messenger \ufdfa, the true and truly inspired said, \"(The matter of the creation of) a human being is put together in the womb of the mother in forty days, and then he becomes a clot of thick blood for a similar period, and then a piece of flesh for a similar period. Then Allah sends an angel who is ordered to write four things. He is ordered to write down his (i.e. the new creature's) deeds, his livelihood, his (date of) death, and whether he will be blessed or wretched (in religion). Then the soul is breathed into him. So, a man amongst you may do (good deeds till there is only a cubit between him and Paradise and then what has been written for him decides his behavior and he starts doing (evil) deeds characteristic of the people of the (Hell) Fire. And similarly a man amongst you may do (evil) deeds till there is only a cubit between him and the (Hell) Fire, and then what has been written for him decides his behavior, and he starts doing deeds characteristic of the people of Paradise.\"[1]\nAbdullah b. Amr b. al-'As reported: I heard Allah's Messenger \ufdfa as saying: Allah ordained the measures (of quality) of the creation fifty thousand years before He created the heavens and the earth, as His Throne was upon water.

And He knows what is on the land and in the sea. Not a leaf falls but that He knows it. And no grain is there within the darknesses of the earth and no moist or dry [thing] but that it is [written] in a clear record.\" \u2014 (Qur'an 6:50)\nIs your rizq decreed?The question arises, if rizq is decreed, then there can be no increase? Yes, and no. The problem which plagues us is awareness or consciousness. We fail to recognize or accept that our knowledge may be deficient/limited. So for all practical purposes, it is best to view qadr from our perspective as infinite possibilities. From Allah's perspective, there is only one since He has complete knowledge and knows the ending of all things, \"...with Him are the keys of the unseen; none knows them except Him.\"\nA simple illustrative example, He may have decreed to the angels at birth to write for us $1,000,000, but at the end of our lifetime, it could have increased to $2,000,000 since His believer was devout and spread a lot of good into this world. The outcome of $2,000,000 was originally written and known by Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670, but it was not known to anyone else. As an analogy, a person watching a movie with a friend who hasn't seen the film knows all the plot twists and turns. And so, the most productive outlook we can have in such matters is approaching each day with our best foot forward. To try and go to bed a little wiser and to have some more good deeds under your belt than from when you first woke up. We need not complicate matters any further by thinking if my provision was decreed and it was guaranteed, then I can't do anything and should let things unfold and manifest. This is foolish thinking.\n\n\nJabir reported: The Messenger of Allah \ufdfa, peace and blessings be upon him, said, \"Were the son of Adam to flee from his provision as he flees from death, his provision would surely reach him just as death will reach him.\" [3]\nUmar bin Al-Khattab narrated that the Messenger of Allah \ufdfa said: \"If you were to rely upon Allah with the required reliance, then He would provide for you just as a bird is provided for, it goes out in the morning empty, and returns full.\" [4]\nThe hadith clearly mentions that the birds have to go out in the morning, each and every day, in search of their rizq. This signifies the importance of not neglecting your duty in taking action. (Make note we mention in the name Ar-Razzaq that rizq is of many types. Here we have been referring to it in the sense of the material). The hadith also does not neglect the role of seeking Allah's trust that He knows what's best for us. And so we turn to Him because we need Him. He is the source for which all things come forth, so we make du'a so to receive His blessings.\nWe've been given many examples in the Qur'an of how rizq has been distributed and the ways in which it is received and deserved. For example, in the name Al-Qadir, we mentioned how Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 gave Prophet Zakariya (as) a child, despite His old age and His wife is barren. This is the qadr of Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 but was only made a reality because of du'a, good deeds, and the righteous character of Prophet Zakariya (as). The Qur'an explicitly mentions, \"So We responded to him, and We gave him John, and amended for him his wife. Indeed, they used to hasten to good deeds and supplicate Us in hope and fear, and they were to Us humbly submissive.\u201d (Qur'an 21:90).\"\nOther ways include purifying our state by means of seeking His forgiveness, \"And said, 'Ask forgiveness of your Lord. Indeed, He is ever a Perpetual Forgiver. He will send [rain from] the sky upon you in [continuing] showers And give you increase in wealth and children and provide for you gardens and provide for you rivers.\" (Qur'an 71:10-12) Also, Narrated Anas bin Malik: I heard Allah's Messenger \ufdfa saying, \"whoever desires an expansion in his sustenance and age, should keep good relations with his Kith and kin.\"[5]\n \u0648\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0648\u06e1 \u0623\u064e\u0646\u0651\u064e \u0623\u064e\u0647\u06e1\u0644\u064e \u0671\u0644\u06e1\u0642\u064f\u0631\u064e\u0649\u0670\u0653 \u0621\u064e\u0627\u0645\u064e\u0646\u064f\u0648\u0627\u0652 \u0648\u064e\u0671\u062a\u0651\u064e\u0642\u064e\u0648\u06e1\u0627\u0652 \u0644\u064e\u0641\u064e\u062a\u064e\u062d\u06e1\u0646\u064e\u0627 \u0639\u064e\u0644\u064e\u064a\u06e1\u0647\u0650\u0645 \u0628\u064e\u0631\u064e\u0643\u064e\u0670\u062a\u0656 \u0645\u0651\u0650\u0646\u064e \u0671\u0644\u0633\u0651\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0627\u0653\u0621\u0650 \u0648\u064e\u0671\u0644\u06e1\u0623\u064e\u0631\u06e1\u0636\u0650 \u0648\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0670\u0643\u0650\u0646 \u0643\u064e\u0630\u0651\u064e\u0628\u064f\u0648\u0627\u0652 \u0641\u064e\u0623\u064e\u062e\u064e\u0630\u06e1\u0646\u064e\u0670\u0647\u064f\u0645 \u0628\u0650\u0645\u064e\u0627 \u0643\u064e\u0627\u0646\u064f\u0648\u0627\u0652 \u064a\u064e\u0643\u06e1\u0633\u0650\u0628\u064f\u0648\u0646\u064e\nWa law anna ahlal quraaa aamanoo wattaqaw lafatahnaa \u2018alaihim barakaatim minas samaaa'i wal ardi wa laakin kazzaboo fa akhaznaahum bimaa kaanoo yaksiboon\nEnglish Translation:\"And if only the people of the cities had believed and feared Allah, We would have opened upon them blessings from the heaven and the earth; but they denied [the messengers], so We seized them for what they were earning.\" \u2014 (Qur'an 7:96)\nSo in many ways, the believer benefits from knowing that Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 is Al-Muqaddim. He has the power to bring forth many sweetnesses in our life. It could be that marriage you're searching for, the job that pays well and enables your family to be supported, or a beautiful, healthy child which you desire.

            "mentions-from-quran-hadith": "\n\nArabic Root:From the root hamza-kha-ra (\u0623 \u062e \u0631), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to cause, to go back, backwards, retreat, recede, to retire, to drive back, to put behind or after, to cause, to remain behind, hang back, lag behind, to postpone, put off, or delay.\nThe names Al-Mu'akhkhir and Al-Muqqadim are two names in this series that are closely connected and should be mentioned together for complete comprehension. Al-Muqqadim is The Promoter, or the one who brings forth, and the other is Al-Mu'akhkhir, The Postponer, or the one who pushes away.\nFor this section, we will focus on what it means for Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 to be called by the name Al-Mu'akhkhir. You can also go back to the previous name, where we discuss Al-Muqqadim in more depth. The first interpretation is that Al-Mu'akhkhir is the one who pushes away whom He wills. Some of His creations are honored and promoted, like His angels, prophets, friends, and scholars. But the enemies of Islam He pushes away and banishes them. A clear example from the Qur'an would be the nation of 'Aad, \"And that was 'Aad, who rejected the signs of their Lord and disobeyed His messengers and followed the order of every obstinate tyrant. And they were [therefore] followed in this world with a curse and [as well] on the Day of Resurrection. Unquestionably, 'Aad denied their Lord; then away with 'Aad, the people of Hud.\" (Qur'an 11:59-60)\n Du'a from hadith book:For the name Al-Muqqadim, no ayah in the Qur'an explicitly calls upon this name.

There is none to be worshipped but you\" [1] \nA helpful Qur'anic verse:In the Qur'an, one verse refers to the words qaddama and wa akhkhar, which, if we analyze, can further help us understand the meaning of both names.\n \u064a\u064f\u0646\u064e\u0628\u064e\u0651\u0624\u064f\u0627\u0652 \u0671\u0644\u06e1\u0625\u0650\u0646\u0633\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064f \u064a\u064e\u0648\u06e1\u0645\u064e\u0626\u0650\u0630\u0650\u06ed \u0628\u0650\u0645\u064e\u0627 \u0642\u064e\u062f\u064e\u0651\u0645\u064e \u0648\u064e\u0623\u064e\u062e\u064e\u0651\u0631\u064e\nYunabba ul insaanu yawma 'izim bimaa qaddama wa akhkhar\nEnglish Translation: \"Man will be informed that Day of what he sent ahead and kept back\" \u2014 (Qur'an 75:13)\nIn this ayah, Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 is instructing us to hasten to do good because on the day of resurrection, we will bring forth (qaddama) all of our deeds and they will testify to the good or bad that we've done. Next, it mentions (wa akhkhar), things we've left behind or kept back. This implies different meanings. Some commentators suggest it can mean leaving behind evil on earth, others interpret it in the affirmative, leaving behind a good legacy that perpetuates good for him even after he has returned to Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 (e.g., sadaqah jariyah - a perpetual, on-going charity).  Allah's Messenger \ufdfa said: He who introduced some good practice in Islam which was followed after him (by people) he would be assured of reward like one who followed it, without their rewards being diminished in any respect. And he who introduced some evil practice in Islam which had been followed subsequently (by others), he would be required to bear the burden like that of one who followed this (evil practice) without their's being diminished in any respect.[2]\n\n\nTrials from the life of the Prophets:One thing that's important to understand is Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 doesn't just delay or demote things for quote-unquote 'bad people,' for lack of a better term. Some pious people are delayed in marriage or in having kids. Each person has their own fitnah (meaning trial or affliction) to the level Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 knows they're capable of shouldering. \"And We will surely test you with something of fear and hunger and a loss of wealth and lives and fruits, but give good tidings to the patient,\" (2:155), and \"Allah does not charge a soul except [with that within] its capacity.\" (2:286) We must recognize He is Aleemul Hakeem, the all-knowing, the all-wise and see that things don't just happen, they happen just (i.e., by the will of Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670).\nWe can even briefly study the lives of the Prophets to understand how He delays even those closest to Him. For example, in the story of Prophet Ayyub (as) he lost everything in a great tragedy that killed all His children. In the account of Ibn Kathir:\nSatan once again visited Ayyub disguised as sympathising bystander, and remarked with sorrow, \"The circumstances under which your children died were sad. Surely, your Lord is not rewarding you properly for all your prayers.\" Ayyub responded, \"Allah gives me what is good for me, and takes away what Allah sees that is displeasing for Him and for me. Allah sees that all of these children may be a strong test & trial for me, so Allah took them away from me. Whether a thing is beneficial or harmful to me, I will remain firm in my belief and remain thankful to my Creator.\" \nThe same can be said for Prophet Nuh (as). Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 showed mercy, He gave people every chance to listen and seek His guidance, but only a few did. Prophet Nuh (as) had to endure 950 years of preaching to an unreceptive and at times, hostile crowd, \"And We certainly sent Noah to his people, and he remained among them a thousand years minus fifty years, and the flood seized them while they were wrongdoers.\" (Qur'an 29:14) Even when the flood came from Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 a clear sign of their disobedience, Nuh (as) wife and son were still was among deniers and they drowned in the flood, \"[But the son] answered: \"I shall betake myself to a mountain that will protect me from the waters.\" Said [Noah]: \"Today there is no protection [for anyone] from God's judgment, save [for] those who have earned [His] mercy!\" And a wave rose up between them, and [the son] was among those who were drowned\" (Qur'an 11:43)\nReflection:From these two names, Al-Muqaddim, and Al-Mu'akhkhir, the believer understands whether Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 decrees for us promotion or delay we must not waver in our faith. Wallaahu khairul maakireen,  \"Allah is the best of planners.\" [3] We must accept His decree graciously and endure patiently, for there is wisdom in it. And if you have fallen back, do not despair, for Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 is Al-Muqaddim, the one brings forward. This is why it's important to mention the names together. So as to not lose hope in Him. There is nothing that can't stop Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 mercy and to increase you in all aspects of living a good life. So never despair. As long as you are breathing Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 can improve your situation.

            "mentions-from-quran-hadith": "\n\nArabic Root:From the root hamza-waw-lam (\u0623 \u0648 \u0644), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to be first, principle, to be before, to come back to, to return, to precede, to be the first part, to be foremost.\nTawhid & Tawakkul:The understanding and belief in the name establishes tawheed (oneness of Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670). Al-Awwal means He was first or is the first. But this does not mean that there was nothing before. Rather the beginning was Him. He exists without a beginning and is the source from which everything comes into existence. From this name, we see how He is from ever and forever, and He is never absent and always present. It is a reminder we should rely upon Him alone (the concept of tawakkul).\nThe First & The Last:Al-Awwal also implies an opposite. If there is a first, then there must be a last, and this is the name Al-Akhir. This does not mean that Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 has a beginning and an end. Instead, it tells us He is the start, and He is the end. It's the race of life; we start with Him and return to Him. In this race, some may try to take shortcuts only to get lost, and the wiser pace themselves, knowing it's a marathon. A few may try to trip or sabotage others to gain an advantage, but they fail to see the race is within themselves. There is no first or second-place prize. At the end of the journey, the satisfied will be those who gave their best effort; they struggled beautifully and gave it their all. For them will be the prize of the akhirah, Insha-Allah. You don't want to have reached the end of the race to realize you had much more to offer; you want to be tired at the end.\nIn The Name & the Named, Sheikh Tosun Bayrak writes, \"It is proper to read, recite, and consider the attributes \"The First\" and \"The Last\" together because the meaning is like a circle where the first and the last are one.\" This interpretation seems to describe these two names accurately. Imam Ghazali mentions something similar, \"So He is last with respect to wayfaring [there is nothing that will succeed him], and first with respect to existence: the first beginning was from Him; and to Him is the last return and destination.\"\n \u0647\u064f\u0648\u064e \u0671\u0644\u06e1\u0623\u064e\u0648\u0651\u064e\u0644\u064f \u0648\u064e\u0671\u0644\u06e1\u0623\u0653\u062e\u0650\u0631\u064f \u0648\u064e\u0671\u0644\u0638\u0651\u064e\u0640\u0670\u0647\u0650\u0631\u064f \u0648\u064e\u0671\u0644\u06e1\u0628\u064e\u0627\u0637\u0650\u0646\u064f\u06d6 \u0648\u064e\u0647\u064f\u0648\u064e \u0628\u0650\u0643\u064f\u0644\u0651\u0650 \u0634\u064e\u064a\u06e1\u0621\u064d \u0639\u064e\u0644\u0650\u064a\u0645\u064c\nHuwal Awwalu wal'Aakhiru waz Zaahiru wal Baatinu wa huwa bikulli shai'in Aleem\nEnglish Translation:\"He is the First and the Last, the Ascendant and the Intimate, and He is, of all things, Knowing.\" \u2014 (Qur'an 57:3)\n \u0671\u0644\u0651\u064e\u0630\u0650\u064a\u0646\u064e  \u0625\u0650\u0630\u064e\u0627\u0653  \u0623\u064e\u0635\u064e\u0670\u0628\u064e\u062a\u06e1\u0647\u064f\u0645  \u0645\u0651\u064f\u0635\u0650\u064a\u0628\u064e\u0629\u065e  \u0642\u064e\u0627\u0644\u064f\u0648\u0653\u0627\u0652  \u0625\u0650\u0646\u0651\u064e\u0627  \u0644\u0650\u0644\u0651\u064e\u0647\u0650  \u0648\u064e\u0625\u0650\u0646\u0651\u064e\u0627\u0653  \u0625\u0650\u0644\u064e\u064a\u06e1\u0647\u0650  \u0631\u064e\u0670\u062c\u0650\u0639\u064f\u0648\u0646\u064e\nAllazeena izaaa asaabathum museebatun qaalooo innaa lillaahi wa innaaa ilaihi raaji'oon\nEnglish Translation:\"Who, when disaster strikes them, say, 'Indeed we belong to Allah, and indeed to Him we will return.'\" \u2014 (Qur'an 2:156)\nThe case of the curious mind:It is narrated on the authority of Abu Huraira that the Messenger of Allah \ufdfa said: Men will continue to question one another till this is propounded: Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 created all things but who created Allah? He who found himself confronted with such a situation should say: I affirm my faith in Allah. [1]\n\n\nTo those with a curious minds, we can't fathom how something can exist from nothing. We're so ingrained by our experiences as to seeing how one thing gives birth to another that we ask the same question of God. But as Prophet \ufdfa tells the companions who ask Him this question, he replies that it's a matter of faith. The Qur'an addresses the hypocrites and the disbelievers in many verses.

Indeed in that is a mercy and reminder for a people who believe.\" \u2014 (Qur'an 29:51)\nThe human mind has many limitations, and we often fool ourselves. We don't know what we don't know, and we can't know the limits of how our intelligence may be bounded. A lot of psychological work has been done to show the many ways in which we're unreliable narrators. One such fallacy is the illusion of explanatory depth (IOED). If we look at the simplest of things we use every day and try to explain in detail how they work, we quickly realize that much of our knowledge is surface level. For example, what's a toilet? We likely answer with confidence what seems to be a silly question. Of course, we know what it is and how to operate one, but when you press the flush button, what's really happening underneath the tank? That's what makes the toilet a toilet. It seems like a strange analogy, but the point is we are often unaware of our ignorance, yet we ask irrelevant questions of Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 that we cannot comprehend.

The next name in this series is Az-Zahir.X \nArabic Root:From the root hamza-kha-ra (\u0623 \u062e \u0631), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to put back, to put behind, to be latter to postpone, to put at the end to be last, final, ultimate.\nTawhid & Tawakkul:The understanding and belief in the name establishes tawheed (oneness of Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670). Al-Awwal means He was first or is the first. But this does not mean that there was nothing before. Rather the beginning was Him. He exists without a beginning and is the source from which everything comes into existence. From this name, we see how He is from ever and forever, and He is never absent and always present. It is a reminder we should rely upon Him alone (the concept of tawakkul).\nThe First & The Last:Al-Awwal also implies an opposite. If there is a first, then there must be a last, and this is the name Al-Akhir. This does not mean that Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 has a beginning and an end. Instead, it tells us He is the start, and He is the end. It's the race of life; we start with Him and return to Him. In this race, some may try to take shortcuts only to get lost, and the wiser pace themselves, knowing it's a marathon. A few may try to trip or sabotage others to gain an advantage, but they fail to see the race is within themselves. There is no first or second-place prize. At the end of the journey, the satisfied will be those who gave their best effort; they struggled beautifully and gave it their all. For them will be the prize of the akhirah, Insha-Allah. You don't want to have reached the end of the race to realize you had much more to offer; you want to be tired at the end.\nIn The Name & the Named, Sheikh Tosun Bayrak writes, \"It is proper to read, recite, and consider the attributes \"The First\" and \"The Last\" together because the meaning is like a circle where the first and the last are one.\" This interpretation seems to describe these two names accurately.

We're so ingrained by our experiences as to seeing how one thing gives birth to another that we ask the same question of God. But as Prophet \ufdfa tells the companions who ask Him this question, he replies that it's a matter of faith. The Qur'an addresses the hypocrites and the disbelievers in many verses.

Indeed in that is a mercy and reminder for a people who believe.\" \u2014 (Qur'an 29:51)\nThe human mind has many limitations, and we often fool ourselves. We don't know what we don't know, and we can't know the limits of how our intelligence may be bounded. A lot of psychological work has been done to show the many ways in which we're unreliable narrators. One such fallacy is the illusion of explanatory depth (IOED). If we look at the simplest of things we use every day and try to explain in detail how they work, we quickly realize that much of our knowledge is surface level. For example, what's a toilet? We likely answer with confidence what seems to be a silly question. Of course, we know what it is and how to operate one, but when you press the flush button, what's really happening underneath the tank? That's what makes the toilet a toilet. It seems like a strange analogy, but the point is we are often unaware of our ignorance, yet we ask irrelevant questions of Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 that we cannot comprehend. And so, the answer Prophet Muhammad \ufdfa gives just may be the most intelligent answer to the question.\nSupplication from hadith using these two names:There is a nice du'a mentioned in the hadith literature, which tells us what he would sometimes recite before going to bed.

He \ufdfa calls upon these two names Al-Awwal and Al-Akhir, and we've highlighted them for your reference.\n\n\u0627\u0644\u0644\u0651\u064e\u0647\u064f\u0645\u0651\u064e \u0631\u064e\u0628\u0651\u064e \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0651\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0648\u064e\u0627\u062a\u0650 \u0648\u064e\u0631\u064e\u0628\u0651\u064e \u0627\u0644\u0623\u064e\u0631\u0652\u0636\u0650 \u0648\u064e\u0631\u064e\u0628\u0651\u064e \u0627\u0644\u0652\u0639\u064e\u0631\u0652\u0634\u0650 \u0627\u0644\u0652\u0639\u064e\u0638\u0650\u064a\u0645\u0650 \u0631\u064e\u0628\u0651\u064e\u0646\u064e\u0627 \u0648\u064e\u0631\u064e\u0628\u0651\u064e \u0643\u064f\u0644\u0651\u0650 \u0634\u064e\u0649\u0652\u0621\u064d \u0641\u064e\u0627\u0644\u0650\u0642\u064e \u0627\u0644\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0628\u0651\u0650 \u0648\u064e\u0627\u0644\u0646\u0651\u064e\u0648\u064e\u0649 \u0648\u064e\u0645\u064f\u0646\u0652\u0632\u0650\u0644\u064e \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0651\u064e\u0648\u0652\u0631\u064e\u0627\u0629\u0650 \u0648\u064e\u0627\u0644\u0625\u0650\u0646\u0652\u062c\u0650\u064a\u0644\u0650 \u0648\u064e\u0627\u0644\u0652\u0641\u064f\u0631\u0652\u0642\u064e\u0627\u0646\u0650 \u0623\u064e\u0639\u064f\u0648\u0630\u064f \u0628\u0650\u0643\u064e \u0645\u0650\u0646\u0652 \u0634\u064e\u0631\u0651\u0650 \u0643\u064f\u0644\u0651\u0650 \u0634\u064e\u0649\u0652\u0621\u064d \u0623\u064e\u0646\u0652\u062a\u064e \u0622\u062e\u0650\u0630\u064c \u0628\u0650\u0646\u064e\u0627\u0635\u0650\u064a\u064e\u062a\u0650\u0647\u0650 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0651\u064e\u0647\u064f\u0645\u0651\u064e \u0623\u064e\u0646\u0652\u062a\u064e \u0627\u0644\u0623\u064e\u0648\u0651\u064e\u0644\u064f \u0641\u064e\u0644\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0633\u064e \u0642\u064e\u0628\u0652\u0644\u064e\u0643\u064e \u0634\u064e\u0649\u0652\u0621\u064c \u0648\u064e\u0623\u064e\u0646\u0652\u062a\u064e \u0627\u0644\u0622\u062e\u0650\u0631\u064f \u0641\u064e\u0644\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0633\u064e \u0628\u064e\u0639\u0652\u062f\u064e\u0643\u064e \u0634\u064e\u0649\u0652\u0621\u064c \u0648\u064e\u0623\u064e\u0646\u0652\u062a\u064e \u0627\u0644\u0638\u0651\u064e\u0627\u0647\u0650\u0631\u064f \u0641\u064e\u0644\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0633\u064e \u0641\u064e\u0648\u0652\u0642\u064e\u0643\u064e \u0634\u064e\u0649\u0652\u0621\u064c \u0648\u064e\u0623\u064e\u0646\u0652\u062a\u064e \u0627\u0644\u0652\u0628\u064e\u0627\u0637\u0650\u0646\u064f \u0641\u064e\u0644\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0633\u064e \u062f\u064f\u0648\u0646\u064e\u0643\u064e \u0634\u064e\u0649\u0652\u0621\u064c \u0627\u0642\u0652\u0636\u0650 \u0639\u064e\u0646\u0651\u064e\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0651\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0646\u064e \u0648\u064e\u0623\u064e\u063a\u0652\u0646\u0650\u0646\u064e\u0627 \u0645\u0650\u0646\u064e \u0627\u0644\u0652\u0641\u064e\u0642\u0652\u0631\u0650  \nSuhail reported that Abu Salih used to command us (in these words): When any one of you intends to go to sleep, he should lie on the bed on his right side and then say: \"O Allah. the Lord of the Heavens and the Lord of the Earth and Lord of the Magnificent Throne, our Lord, and the Lord of evervthing, the Splitter of the grain of corn and the datestone (or fruit kernal), the Revealer of Torah and Injil (Bible) and Criterion (the Holy Qur'an), I seek refuge in Thee from the evil of every - thing Thou art to sieze by the forelock (Thou hast perfect control over it).

The first pairing is Al-Awwal and Al-Akhir (The First and The Last). The following two names which will be the focus of this section are Az-Zahir and Al-Batin (The Manifest, The Hidden). We included three different translations of this ayah to help us see understand the nuances.\nA pairing paradox:At first, the pairing of Al-Zahir and Al-Batin seems contradictory. How can something be both manifest yet hidden? One interpretation is He is outwardly manifested, all that exists serves as clear proof of His manifestation, as well as His knowledge and His power. But He is hidden in plain sight, He appears before everything, and it should be apparent, but they ignore the truth presented right in front of them. Another view of Al-Zahir that is also reflected in the translations is that He is transcendent above all, predominating over them. He is High above, a clear witness over everything, and He knows all which is concealed or hidden. He is fully acquainted with His servants and knows their inner dimensions.\nImam Ghazali mentions these two attributes that Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 is manifest and hidden, referring to the mode of perception. If you need to \"see it to believe it,\" you will surely miss Him. But if you find the ways in which He manifests Himself through the Prophets (may peace be upon them), His books, religion, power, knowledge, and all the ways He's supplied blessings for you, you will surely find Him.

Indeed, He is Most High and Wise.\" \u2014 (Qur'an 42:51)\nAl-Ghazali gives an illustrative example of how, if you read a page of a book, would you doubt that the author exists? Or would you recognize the author's existence for the book to exist? We could go one step further and infer from what was written that they were knowledgeable and assume they had the qualities of sight and hearing. [1] Now, if you take a second to ponder the arrangement of the universe. See all its perfectly managed complexity. Why do you need to see the organizer to validate His existence? The creation and perfect arrangement of all the atoms and molecules, everything around us, is a clear manifest proof of His existence. It speaks volumes about all of His glorious attributes. Even we can see the wisdom in His book, Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 had authored all of creation, kun fa-yakoon, \"'Be', and it is!\" (Qur'an 36:82). This also brings us back to the first pairing we mentioned (Al-Awwal and Al-Akhir), recognizing Him as the originator or the source for all creation.\nIt was narrated from Umar that Jibreel \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0644\u0627\u0645 said to the Prophet \ufdfa: What is faith (iman)? He said: \u201cTo believe in Allah, His Angels, His Books, His Messengers, the Last Day and the divine decree, both good and bad,\u201d Jibreel said to him: You have spoken the truth. He said: We were amazed that he asked him and then confirmed his answers as being correct. The Prophet \ufdfa said: \"That was J\u012bbreel, who came to teach you your religion.`\" [2]\nIt is also worth mentioning that Surah Al-An'am ayah 120 notes two Arabic words, zaahiral and baatinah, but not in the context of Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 glorious names. Rather, these words were a message to the believers about what is permissible and forbidden.

The first pairing is Al-Awwal and Al-Akhir (The First and The last). The following two names which will be the focus of this section are Al-Zahir and Al-Batin (The Manifest, The Hidden). We included three different translations of this ayah to help us see understand the nuances.\nA pairing paradox:At first, the pairing of Al-Zahir and Al-Batin seems contradictory. How can something be both manifest yet hidden? One interpretation is He is outwardly manifested, all that exists serves as clear proof of His manifestation, as well as His knowledge and His power. But He is hidden in plain sight, He appears before everything, and it should be apparent, but they ignore the truth presented right in front of them. Another view of Al-Zahir that is also reflected in the translations is that He is transcendent above all, predominating over them. He is High above, a clear witness over everything, and He knows all which is concealed or hidden. He is fully acquainted with His servants and knows their inner dimensions.\nImam Ghazali mentions these two attributes that Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 is manifest and hidden, referring to the mode of perception. If you need to \"see it to believe it,\" you will surely miss Him. But if you find the ways in which He manifests Himself through the Prophets (may peace be upon them), His books, religion, power, knowledge, and all the ways He's supplied blessings for you, you will surely find Him.

Indeed, He is Most High and Wise.\" (Qur'an 42:51)\nAl-Ghazali gives an illustrative example of how, if you read a page of a book, would you doubt that the author exists? Or would you recognize the author's existence for the book to exist? We could go one step further and infer from what was written that they were knowledgeable and assume they had the qualities of sight and hearing. [1, see note] Now, if you take a second to ponder the arrangement of the universe. See all its perfectly managed complexity. Why do you need to see the organizer to validate His existence? The creation and perfect arrangement of all the atoms and molecules, everything around us, is a clear manifest proof of His existence. It speaks volumes about all of His glorious attributes. Even we can see the wisdom in His book, Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 had authored all of creation, kun fa-yakoon, \"'Be', and it is!\" (Qur'an 36:82). This also brings us back to the first pairing we mentioned (Al-Awwal and Al-Akhir), recognizing Him as the originator or the source for all creation.\nIt was narrated from Umar that Jibreel \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0644\u0627\u0645 said to the Prophet \ufdfa: What is faith (iman)? He said: \u201cTo believe in Allah, His Angels, His Books, His Messengers, the Last Day and the divine decree, both good and bad,\u201d Jibreel said to him: You have spoken the truth. He said: We were amazed that he asked him and then confirmed his answers as being correct.

Of the 99 names, 81 are explicitly mentioned in the Qur'an. Therefore, there isn't one agreed-upon list for the remaining 18 names. Al-Wali is one of those names that is deduced and, therefore, not included on the list of certain scholars. This includes Ibn Mandah, Ibn Hazm, and Ibn Hajar, among others. However, others, such as Imam al-Bayhaqi and Imam al-Ghazali, have included this name in their lists. Note as an attribute to describe Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 it is valid.\nTo be a ruler...This name is also not to be confused with one we've already discussed in Al-Waliyy (\u0671\u0644\u0652\u0648\u064e\u0644\u0650\u064a\u064f\u0651) - The Protecting Associate. Here Al-Wali (\u0671\u0644\u0652\u0648\u064e\u0627\u0644\u0650\u064a) refers to being the ruler or guardian, and this encompasses three qualities. Imam Ghazali mentions that being a governor requires organization, power, and action. Failure in any of these respects relinquishes the title of being called the true ruler.\nBelow are just a few verses that mention Allah's complete dominion. It demonstrates how He is the best planner, the all-powerful king, and the one who manages the affairs of all things.\nFrom the Qur'an:There are no direct mentions of the name Al-Wali, but we can understand this attribute further by verses that describe this quality from the Qur'an.\n \u0648\u064e\u0625\u0650\u0630\u06e1 \u064a\u064e\u0645\u06e1\u0643\u064f\u0631\u064f \u0628\u0650\u0643\u064e \u0671\u0644\u0651\u064e\u0630\u0650\u064a\u0646\u064e \u0643\u064e\u0641\u064e\u0631\u064f\u0648\u0627\u0652 \u0644\u0650\u064a\u064f\u062b\u06e1\u0628\u0650\u062a\u064f\u0648\u0643\u064e \u0623\u064e\u0648\u06e1 \u064a\u064e\u0642\u06e1\u062a\u064f\u0644\u064f\u0648\u0643\u064e \u0623\u064e\u0648\u06e1 \u064a\u064f\u062e\u06e1\u0631\u0650\u062c\u064f\u0648\u0643\u064e\u06da \u0648\u064e\u064a\u064e\u0645\u06e1\u0643\u064f\u0631\u064f\u0648\u0646\u064e \u0648\u064e\u064a\u064e\u0645\u06e1\u0643\u064f\u0631\u064f \u0671\u0644\u0644\u0651\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06d6 \u0648\u064e\u0671\u0644\u0644\u0651\u064e\u0647\u064f \u062e\u064e\u064a\u06e1\u0631\u064f \u0671\u0644\u06e1\u0645\u064e\u0670\u0643\u0650\u0631\u0650\u064a\u0646\u064e\nWa iz yamkuru bikal lazeena kafaroo liyusbitooka aw yaqtulooka aw yukhrijook; wa yamkuroona wa yamkurul laahu wallaahu khairul maakireen\nEnglish Translation:\"And [remember, O Muhammad], when those who disbelieved plotted against you to restrain you or kill you or evict you [from Makkah].

He understands that real control comes from the commandments of whatever Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 wills. No one can dictate otherwise. It should further solidify the notion of reliance upon Him for all matters. He is the one who organizes the plan, puts it into action, and then preserves it. Shaykh Tosun Barak writes, \"the whole of creation is governed by Allah's knowledge and power: not a leaf moves without His will. Neither is the movement of the leaf disconnected from other things moved by the same wind, by the same will.\"\nSo all matters are in the care of Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670, our being is part of a divine order He has planned. He is Al-Wali (The Ruler) and Al-Waliyy (The Protecting Associate). But one must realize that what may be good for you may not be in the way you want. Each caliphate asked Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 for wellbeing and protection, yet Umar Ibn Al-Khattab (ra) was martyred. Even Ali ibn Abi Talib (ra) was killed and martyred. Some may wonder about the justice in that, but the real reward is in the hereafter. The reward of one's actions is not necessarily manifested in this life. If it is, that is a blessing or a gift from Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670, but it shouldn't be the primary motivation.\nIt was narrated that Sa'eed bin Zaid bin 'Amr bin Nufail said:\n\"The Messenger of Allah was one of the Ten (given glad tidings of Paradise). He said: 'Abu Bakr will be in Paradise; 'Umar will be in Paradise; 'Uthman will be in Paradise; 'Ali will be in Paradise; Talhah will be in Paradise; Zubair will be in Paradise; Sa'd will be in Paradise; 'Abdur-Rahman will be in Paradise.\" He was asked: 'Who will be the ninth?' He said: 'I will.'\"\n [1]\nReflections:\n[1] Sahih (Darussalam) Sunan Ibn Majah 133 & Sunan Abi Dawud 4649\n\n\n",

Al-Aliyy means \"The High\" or \"The Exalted.\" Al-Muta'ali is related to this name, but its meaning is intensified. So, He is \"The Most High\" or the \"Supremely Exalted.\" Dr. Sayyed Mohammad Reza, in his book titled \"Divine Names & Attributes In The Holy Qur'an,\"\nAllah the Exalted is 'Ali because to Him belongs highness and all of its aspects, highness of His Essence, highness of His attributes and esteem, Highness of strength and power. He is the one who has risen over His throne and the who has encompassed the dominion.

To enumerate His kindness is an impossible task. We will never be able to grasp all the ways in which He has blessed us. If we were to show our gratitude, it would never be enough. There are just so many layers to His mercy and kindness: His gift of creation, to instill in us a soul, to protect us every day from harm, to give us the earth and the ability to enjoy all its fruits, to listen and answer our prayers, to forgive our sins and give us a multiplicative reward for our good. He's given us guidance through His Prophets (may peace be upon them) and His book so we can live a purposeful life instead of meandering about aimlessly.

But this does not discourage from the actual act, because \"if he intends to do a good deed and actually did it, then Allah will write for him with Him from ten to seven hundred times to many more times.\" However, the same standard is not applied for bad or evil thoughts, it will not be recorded until put into action. [1]\n\n\nThe believer benefits from knowing that Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 is Al-Barr. He sees the kindness of His Lord, which increases his love and gratitude towards Him. We understand how His mercy will always be available if sought after. Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 is clear and true in His promise if we do certain things, He will grant us what we seek. Furthermore, upon reflecting on this name, we ask ourselves, how can we be among the doers of good? A'isha, the wife of Allah's Apostle \ufdfa, reported that Allah's Messenger \ufdfa said: A'isha, verily Allah is kind and He loves kindness and confers upon kindness which he does not confer upon severity and does not confer upon anything else besides it (kindness). [2]\nWhy withhold kindness? Why withhold the goodness and ripple effects it can create? Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 tells us He loves kindness and rewards His servant when he's in service to others. Hearing the right thing at the right time can have a profound effect on the trajectory of a person's life. It can unlock dreams unimagined. Words of encouragement can give courage and strength to one suffering, almost like a cure to an illness or a plant in need of water. But of course, the other side of the coin reads words can create havoc if we're not careful. Fights, wars, and ties of kinships have all been severed just from the movement of the tongue. It is more powerful than we like to give it credit. Narrated Abu Musa: Some people asked Allah's Messenger \ufdfa, \"Whose Islam is the best? (I.e., Who is a the best Muslim)?\" He replied, \"One who avoids harming the Muslims with his tongue and hands.\" [3]\nJarir b. Abdullah reported Allah's Apostle \ufdfa as saying: He who is deprived of tenderly feelings is in fact deprived of good. [4]\nThis is something Prophet Muhammad \ufdfa understood and taught, which is likely part of the reason why he was so beloved. He never missed the opportunity to spread love. Don't assume your child knows you're proud of them... take the time to tell them. Don't assume your spouse knows you love them... make it a point to tell them. It is best for us and everyone not to be deprived of feelings of affection and kindness because if you do, you will have stopped goodness and created a void that can be filled with shaitan. The repercussion will also be felt on the day of judgment as we've limited the goodness that's receivable in our accounts.\nReferences:\n[1] Sahih al-Bukhari 6491\n[2] Sahih Muslim 2593\n[3] Sahih al-Bukhari 11\n[4] Sahih Muslim 2592c\n\n\n",

This name makes an appearance in 11 different verses of the Qur'an. Now, being the acceptor of repentance is the most commonly understood meaning of this name. This is what is meant by seeking Tawbah, i.e., you return to Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 asking for forgiveness. But this misses an important quality of what it means to be At-Taawab. The root of both contains the idea of turning, i.e., changing directions to something else.\nAllah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 is Al-Tawwab not just in the sense that we turn to Him. But for our prayers to be heard and our sins to be forgiven, He must turn to us, allowing for repentance. It is within reason to see how Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 does not need to turn to those who sin. They often willingly engaged in disobedience and defiance, searching for pleasure in worldly pursuits. Why should Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 turn to this servant who knowingly transgresses against Himself? But yet, Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 in His infinite mercy, kindness, and grace, turns to His servant.

Then the minor sins would be placed before him, and it would be said: On such and such a day you did so and so and on such and such a day you did so and so. He would say: Yes. It will not be possible for him to deny, while he would be afraid lest serious sins should be presented before him. It would be said to him: In place of every evil deed you will have a good deed. He will say: \"My Lord! I have done things I do not see here.\" I indeed saw the Messenger of Allah laugh till his front teeth were exposed.\" [1]\nFrom this hadith, we see yet another example of Allah's kindness and generosity. He is oft-pardoning, and we can see how He loves to forgive. \"Those who avoid the major sins and immoralities, only [committing] slight ones. Indeed, your Lord is vast in forgiveness. He was most knowing of you when He produced you from the earth and when you were fetuses in the wombs of your mothers. So do not claim yourselves to be pure; He is most knowing of who fears Him\" (Qur'an 52:32). Here, it's important to realize that the goal is not to reach perfection, \"do not claim yourselves to be pure.\" This has been interpreted to be understood that Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 expects us to slip and fall, for the minor sins He forgives without even being asked for \"He is most knowing of you,\" and He's \"vast in forgiveness.\" The other view is that we should not be proud of piety; the ability to do good is because Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 has purified them to be able to do good. It is from Him, and we should be grateful to Him for this ability. There's a difference of opinion regarding \"the major sins,\" for these sins can be forgiven but require active repentance, \"...do not despair of the mercy of Allah. Indeed, Allah forgives all sins. Indeed, it is He who is the Forgiving, the Merciful.\" (Qur'an 39:53).\nGuilt is an interesting emotion and can be seen as a gift from Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670. It can go two ways, (1) destructive and (2) instructive. If we are not careful, the constant repetition of something we know is inherently not good for us or is immoral will cause guilt to fester. It's like a built-in alarm siren that's shouting to change course. If it's ignored, it can erode self-confidence, self-esteem, and overall self-worth. If the action which originally caused guilt becomes normalized, then we may fail to recognize the damage it's causing. The one who sins and no longer fears Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 should be most worried. This person may have developed a deep-rooted belief that they will not have to answer to anyone as they face no serious repercussions for their misdeeds.\n\n\nIn their case, it would be best to read the Qur'an and learn about the warnings and punishment of the afterlife to re-instill this fear. He is merciful and turns to His servant, He gives us the chance to meet Him halfway, but remember Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 is also just. Being able to admit your faults and harbor guilt is a beautiful sign of your belief and dedication to Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670. It is a sign of your iman (faith). Don't let guilt transform into self-hate, don't ever think it's too late for you. At any given moment, you can change. The next nine years don't have to look like the previous nine. \"Allah wants to accept your repentance\" (Qur'an 4:27). It is never too late to seek the forgiveness of your Lord.\nAnas bin Malik narrated that the Messenger of Allah \ufdfa said: \u201cAllah, Blessed is He and Most High, said: \u2018O son of Adam! Verily as long as you called upon Me and hoped in Me, I forgave you, despite whatever may have occurred from you, and I did not mind. O son of Adam!

We briefly mentioned how Prophet Nuh (as) preached for 950 years, \"And We certainly sent Noah to his people, and he remained among them a thousand years minus fifty years, and the flood seized them while they were wrongdoers\" (Qur'an 29:14) The people denied His message, which was one thing, but that rejection turned into harassment, and they slowly grew hostile towards him. The Qur'an even mentions possible death threats Nuh (as) had to endure, \"They said, 'If you do not desist, O Noah, you will surely be of those who are stoned.'\" (Qur'an 26:116) and also, \"The people of Noah denied before them, and they denied Our servant and said, 'A madman,' and he was repelled.\" (Qur'an 54:9). Some Qur'an interpreters mention that stoning may not be literal but refer to constant abuse, slander, or vilification from all sides. This is the view of early Qur'an exegetes with regards to the phrase \"al-shaytan al-rajim\" as literally meaning \"the stoned shaitan\" but now more commonly as \"the accursed satan.\" This symbolizes a metaphorical stoning rather than a literal one. Regardless, after centuries of calling people to embrace Islam but it falling on deaf ears and patiently enduring the abuse, Nuh (as) cried out to his Lord with this supplication\n \u0631\u0651\u064e\u0628\u0651\u0650 \u0671\u063a\u06e1\u0641\u0650\u0631\u06e1 \u0644\u0650\u064a \u0648\u064e\u0644\u0650\u0648\u064e\u0670\u0644\u0650\u062f\u064e\u064a\u0651\u064e \u0648\u064e\u0644\u0650\u0645\u064e\u0646 \u062f\u064e\u062e\u064e\u0644\u064e \u0628\u064e\u064a\u06e1\u062a\u0650\u064a\u064e \u0645\u064f\u0624\u06e1\u0645\u0650\u0646\u0657\u0627 \u0648\u064e\u0644\u0650\u0644\u06e1\u0645\u064f\u0624\u06e1\u0645\u0650\u0646\u0650\u064a\u0646\u064e \u0648\u064e\u0671\u0644\u06e1\u0645\u064f\u0624\u06e1\u0645\u0650\u0646\u064e\u0670\u062a\u0650\u06d6 \u0648\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0627 \u062a\u064e\u0632\u0650\u062f\u0650 \u0671\u0644\u0638\u0651\u064e\u0640\u0670\u0644\u0650\u0645\u0650\u064a\u0646\u064e \u0625\u0650\u0644\u0651\u064e\u0627 \u062a\u064e\u0628\u064e\u0627\u0631\u064e\u06e2\u0627\nRabbigh fir lee wa liwaa lidaiya wa liman dakhala baitiya mu\u2019minanw wa lil mu\u2019mineena wal mu\u2019minaati wa laa tazidiz zaalimeena illaa tabaaraa\nEnglish Translation:\"My Lord, forgive me and my parents and whoever enters my house a believer and the believing men and believing women. And do not increase the wrongdoers except in destruction.\" \u2014 (Qur'an 71:28)\nIn Surah al-Qamar we also learn of the exact du'a Nuh (as) made before the flood:\n \u0641\u064e\u062f\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0627 \u0631\u064e\u0628\u0651\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5\u0653 \u0623\u064e\u0646\u0651\u0650\u064a \u0645\u064e\u063a\u06e1\u0644\u064f\u0648\u0628\u065e \u0641\u064e\u0671\u0646\u062a\u064e\u0635\u0650\u0631\u06e1\nFada\u2019aa Rabbahooo annee maghloobun fantasir\nEnglish Translation:\"So he invoked his Lord, 'Indeed, I am overpowered, so help.'\" \u2014 (Qur'an 54:10)\nAnd so what proceeded was retributive justice, \"Then We opened the gates of the heaven with rain pouring down\" (Qur'an 54:11). The same fate is mentioned of Firawn, \"So We took retribution from them, and We drowned them in the sea because they denied Our signs and were heedless of them.\" (Qur'an 7:136). In every example, you will find that Allah's punishment is not without cause. He is the impartial judge (Al-Hakam. He gives repeated signs of His mercy and allows for the perpetrator to return back to Him (the virtue of also being At-Tawwab). If they decide to remain defiant, defensive, and thankless, then inevitably, they will pay the price.\n\n\nFrom the story of Nuh (as), we also learn that his son was among those who drowned. He refused to accept Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 and even on the day when the storm came, he told his father he rather goes to the top of the hill than with him on the boat. \"[But] he said, 'I will take refuge on a mountain to protect me from the water.' [Noah] said, 'There is no protector today from the decree of Allah, except for whom He gives mercy.' And the waves came between them, and he was among the drowned.\" (Qur'an 11:34)\nThis is a hard but an important lesson. Despite the Prophets (may peace be upon them) being favored by Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 to spread His message, there is no favoritism. Every person will be held accountable for their actions. It does not matter what lineage or bloodline a person comes from.

It provides assurance and peace to victims of abuse that their perpetrator will face the most just of judges. He has complete knowledge and knows the appropriate action to handle each situation.\nIn Imam al-Ghazali's book, he writes the best vengeance is on the enemies of Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670, but the worst of all the enemies is one's lower soul. \"As it is reported regarding Abu Yaz\u012bd - may God be merciful to him that he said: 'My soul was so lazy one night as to keep me from a litany, so I punished it by depriving it of water for a year.\" So take vengeance against oneself in matters where one lets down. In failing to be obedient in worship, in giving, in showing kindness, in repressing anger, in controlling one's tongue. Each person has their own struggle, and in this way, they should pursue the path of vengeance.\n\n\n\n",

            "mentions-from-quran-hadith": "\n\nArabic Root:From the root ayn-fa-waw (\u0639 \u0641 \u0648), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to forgive, pardon, to pass over, forgo, absolve, to obliterate all traces, efface, remove, to kill-off, allow to die, to turn away from punishing, not see, annul, to make unapparent, imperceptible, to give spontaneously, to give without constraint, to give more than what is due.\nThis name compared to other names of forgiveness:Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 loves to forgive His servants. We can see from the previous attributes that much has been said about His forgiveness. He is At-Tawwab (The Ever-Relenting), Ar-Rahman (The Beneficent), Ar-Raheem (The Merciful), Al-Ghaffar (The Forgiver), and Al-Gafoor (The Great Forgiver). Now, we expand to this list by adding another name, Al-Afuw, The Effacer of Sins. He is the one who erases all traces of sin. Forgiveness implies concealment, but the mark of sin still exists on the servant's record. Al-Afuww suggests much more than just forgiving but eliminating it entirely. The view of scholars is the prior names are names of maghfirah (seeking forgiveness) which is different from seeking afw. For example, maghfirah is like forgiving but not forgetting. \u2018afw is purification, being reborn, and having a clean slate. \nAs a name of Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670, Al-Afuw is mentioned for a total of five times in the Qur'an.\n \u0625\u0650\u0646 \u062a\u064f\u0628\u06e1\u062f\u064f\u0648\u0627\u0652 \u062e\u064e\u064a\u06e1\u0631\u064b\u0627 \u0623\u064e\u0648\u06e1 \u062a\u064f\u062e\u06e1\u0641\u064f\u0648\u0647\u064f \u0623\u064e\u0648\u06e1 \u062a\u064e\u0639\u06e1\u0641\u064f\u0648\u0627\u0652 \u0639\u064e\u0646 \u0633\u064f\u0648\u0653\u0621\u0656 \u0641\u064e\u0625\u0650\u0646\u0651\u064e \u0671\u0644\u0644\u0651\u064e\u0647\u064e \u0643\u064e\u0627\u0646\u064e \u0639\u064e\u0641\u064f\u0648\u0651\u0657\u0627 \u0642\u064e\u062f\u0650\u064a\u0631\u064b\u0627\nin tubdoo khairann aw tukhfoohu aw ta\u2019foo \u2018an sooo\u2019in fa innal laaha kaana \u2018afuwwan Qadeeraa\nABUL ALA MAUDUDI TRANSLATION:\"(Even though you have the right to speak evil if you are wronged), if you keep doing good -whether openly or secretly -or at least pardon the evil (then that is the attribute of Allah).

So, we should never feel overwhelmed. We are told in the Qur'an that doubting Allah's mercy is a greater sin than the thing you were worried about in the first place, \"O my sons, go and find out about Joseph and his brother and despair not of relief from Allah. Indeed, no one despairs of relief from Allah except the disbelieving people.\" (Qur'an 12:87) Never give up hope in Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670, and never stop trusting in Him for what you're trying to accomplish. Instead, we should focus on what is within our control, and that is seeking His forgiveness and moving toward spreading as much good as we can. The rest is with Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670.\nThe mercy of Ramadan:One of the signs of His mercy is giving us the month of Ramadan. A chance for us to return to Him and receive His blessings Narrated Abu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger \ufdfa as saying: When there comes the month of Ramadan, the gates of mercy are opened, and the gates of Hell are locked and the devils are chained. [1]\nNarrated Abu Huraira: The Prophet \ufdfa said, \"Whoever established prayers on the night of Qadr out of sincere faith and hoping for a reward from Allah, then all his previous sins will be forgiven; and whoever fasts in the month of Ramadan out of sincere faith, and hoping for a reward from Allah, then all his previous sins will be forgiven.\" [2]\n\n\nIn this month, Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 revealed the first verse of the Qur'an establishing the night of decree (laylatul qadr). This is a night said to have more blessings than a thousand months, \"Indeed, We sent the Qur\u2019an down during the Night of Decree. And what can make you know what is the Night of Decree? The Night of Decree is better than a thousand months. The angels and the Spirit descend therein by permission of their Lord for every matter. Peace it is until the emergence of dawn.\" (Qur'an 97:1-5)\nIt was narrated from Aishah that she said: \"O Messenger of Allah \ufdfa, what do you think I should say in my supplication, if I come upon Laylatul-Qadr?\" He \ufdfa said: [3]\n\n\u0627\u0644\u0644\u0651\u064e\u0647\u064f\u0645\u0651\u064e \u0625\u0650\u0646\u0651\u064e\u0643\u064e  \u0639\u064e\u0641\u064f\u0648\u0651\u064c \u062a\u064f\u062d\u0650\u0628\u0651\u064f \u0627\u0644\u0652\u0639\u064e\u0641\u0652\u0648\u064e \u0641\u064e\u0627\u0639\u0652\u0641\u064f \u0639\u064e\u0646\u0651\u0650\u064a\n\nAllahumma innaka afuwwun tuhibbul-afwa, fa'fu anni\nEnglish Translation:\"O Allah, You are Forgiving and love forgiveness, so forgive me\" \n\nWhen to seek Allah's forgiveness:It's also worth noting that seeking the forgiveness of Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 should not be confined to only when we have knowingly sinned. We know from the sunnah of Prophet Muhammad \ufdfa that he engaged in istighfar (seeking forgiveness) over seventy times a day. Narrated by Abu Huraira: I heard Allah's Messenger \ufdfa saying.\" By Allah! I ask for forgiveness from Allah and turn to Him in repentance more than seventy times a day.\" [4] In some other narrations this number is reported to be as high as one-hundred times a day. [5] Now, keep in mind this is a man beloved and protected by Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 who still feared not receiving the grace of His Lord. Abu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger \ufdfa as saying: None amongst you can get into Paradise by virtue of his deeds alone. They said: Allah's Messenger, not even you? Thereupon he said: Not even I, but that Allah should wrap me in His Grace and Mercy.[6]\nThis, however, should not deter us from doing good deeds. In the Qur'an, it mentions how if a person does good, some of his misdeeds will be converted to good, \"Except for those who repent, believe and do righteous work. For them Allah will replace their evil deeds with good. And ever is Allah Forgiving and Merciful.\" (Qur'an 25:70)\nReferences:\n[1] Sahih Muslim 1079a\n[2] Sahih al-Bukhari 1901\n[3] Sahih (Darussalam) Sunan Ibn Majah 3850\n[4] Sahih al-Bukhari 6307\n[5] Sahih Muslim 2702b \n[6] Sahih Muslim 2702b \n\n\n",

            "mentions-from-quran-hadith": "\n\nArabic Root:From the root ra-hamza-fa (\u0631 \u0623 \u0641), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to be kind, gentle, clement, to be merciful, compassionate, to show pity, to show tenderness.\nDifference between Raheem and Ra'uf:The name of Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 Ar-Rauf, the most kind and compassionate, is mentioned 11 times in the Qur'an. Calling on this name invokes on Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 desire to be tender to His servants. In fact, in the Qur'an, this name is often mentioned in pairs with the names of His mercy. Imam Al-Ghazali writes, \"Al-Ra'uf - the All-Pitying - is one who possess pity, and pity is an intensification of mercy.\"\nSo in a sense, it's similar to the name Ar-Raheem (The Merciful) but exists as a more intensified or emphatic form. The difference is Allah's Rahma (mercy) is shown after a calamity, whereas Ra'fa is before. Narrated Abdullah: I visited the Prophet \ufdfa during his ailments, and he was suffering from a high fever. I said, \"You have a high fever. Is it because you will have a double reward for it?\" He said, \"Yes, for no Muslim is afflicted with any harm but that Allah will remove his sins as the leaves of a tree fall down.\" [1]\nHere tragedy befalls a person, and he/she has been afflicted with some hardship. But this is not without benefit, Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 shows His mercy to that person, and this is atonement from sins. Allah's Messenger \ufdfa said: There is no trouble that comes to a believer except that it obliterates from his sins, even if it is the pricking of a thorn. [2]\nThese two are examples of Rahma or Allah's mercy. Ra'fa manifests in ways of warnings or protection from things that may cause a person harm. He takes pity and showers His mercy so tragedy can be avoided. To receive Allah's compassion means enjoining good here on earth but also for you in the hereafter. This is a higher form of mercy, by giving His servants warnings of actions that will cause damage.

Part of living is our desire to expand endlessly, acquiring things. In this acquisition of land, property, and material, we become deluded. It is easy to become distracted and believe all of this is real and that the goal of living is to consume and conquer. Our ego inflates if we see success, and we are prone to become less akhirah motivated. This is why receiving wealth is a blessing from Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 but also a test in disguise. Will they use their wealth in a manner pleasing to Him, or will they become a servant to their ego?\nTake a second to reflect on this hypothetical scenario, and try to really see yourself in this scenario. You just bought your first home and looking at this beautiful structure, envision all the future memories that'll reside within. What feelings flood your heart and brain? Now, many years have passed. Alhamdulillah, you're doing well financially and closed on your second, third, and looking for a fourth investment properties. What feelings come to you as you stand there looking at each of your properties. In your mind, does the inner dialogue say, \"wow, I can't believe this is mine!\" It's not far-fetched you'd feel this way, but this is where the danger creeps in. The development of this self-image, being \"the owner\" of these properties and land. A sense of great pride and honor envelopes your psyche. The scariest part is you may not even realize it. But how many people stood on this same land before you? How many people before you held a written document proclaiming the ownership of the very land you currently stand on? All were deluded by this temporary ownership. This failure is partly due to the omission and deep resonation with the saying of alhamdulillah (all praise is due to Allah). Allah gives some of His servant's temporary ownership, but He is the eternal owner.\n\n\nThis tiny thought experiment is on such a small scale, but still, we see the nature of the human condition. A few are given the position of extreme wealth, like Firawn or Nimrod. The power which they likely craved was given to them by Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670, and it had corrupted them. They began to feel like untouchable kings with no authority to prevail over them. In Surah Baqarah, it mentions how the tyrant King Nimrod believed he had absolute sovereignty over his land and people. His word became the law of the land. If he was so inclined to kill a man, he could go without recourse.\n \u0623\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0645\u06e1  \u062a\u064e\u0631\u064e  \u0625\u0650\u0644\u064e\u0649  \u0671\u0644\u0651\u064e\u0630\u0650\u064a  \u062d\u064e\u0627\u0653\u062c\u0651\u064e  \u0625\u0650\u0628\u06e1\u0631\u064e\u0670\u0647\u0650\u0640\u06e7\u0645\u064e  \u0641\u0650\u064a  \u0631\u064e\u0628\u0651\u0650\u0647\u0650\u06e6\u0653  \u0623\u064e\u0646\u06e1  \u0621\u064e\u0627\u062a\u064e\u0649\u0670\u0647\u064f  \u0671\u0644\u0644\u0651\u064e\u0647\u064f  \u0671\u0644\u06e1\u0645\u064f\u0644\u06e1\u0643\u064e  \u0625\u0650\u0630\u06e1  \u0642\u064e\u0627\u0644\u064e  \u0625\u0650\u0628\u06e1\u0631\u064e\u0670\u0647\u0650\u0640\u06e7\u0645\u064f  \u0631\u064e\u0628\u0651\u0650\u064a\u064e  \u0671\u0644\u0651\u064e\u0630\u0650\u064a  \u064a\u064f\u062d\u06e1\u064a\u0650\u06e6  \u0648\u064e\u064a\u064f\u0645\u0650\u064a\u062a\u064f  \u0642\u064e\u0627\u0644\u064e  \u0623\u064e\u0646\u064e\u0627\u06e0  \u0623\u064f\u062d\u06e1\u064a\u0650\u06e6  \u0648\u064e\u0623\u064f\u0645\u0650\u064a\u062a\u064f\u06d6  \u0642\u064e\u0627\u0644\u064e  \u0625\u0650\u0628\u06e1\u0631\u064e\u0670\u0647\u0650\u0640\u06e7\u0645\u064f  \u0641\u064e\u0625\u0650\u0646\u0651\u064e  \u0671\u0644\u0644\u0651\u064e\u0647\u064e  \u064a\u064e\u0623\u06e1\u062a\u0650\u064a  \u0628\u0650\u0671\u0644\u0634\u0651\u064e\u0645\u06e1\u0633\u0650  \u0645\u0650\u0646\u064e  \u0671\u0644\u06e1\u0645\u064e\u0634\u06e1\u0631\u0650\u0642\u0650  \u0641\u064e\u0623\u06e1\u062a\u0650  \u0628\u0650\u0647\u064e\u0627  \u0645\u0650\u0646\u064e  \u0671\u0644\u06e1\u0645\u064e\u063a\u06e1\u0631\u0650\u0628\u0650  \u0641\u064e\u0628\u064f\u0647\u0650\u062a\u064e  \u0671\u0644\u0651\u064e\u0630\u0650\u064a  \u0643\u064e\u0641\u064e\u0631\u064e\u06d7  \u0648\u064e\u0671\u0644\u0644\u0651\u064e\u0647\u064f  \u0644\u064e\u0627  \u064a\u064e\u0647\u06e1\u062f\u0650\u064a  \u0671\u0644\u06e1\u0642\u064e\u0648\u06e1\u0645\u064e  \u0671\u0644\u0638\u0651\u064e\u0640\u0670\u0644\u0650\u0645\u0650\u064a\u0646\u064e\nAlam tara ilal lazee Haaajja Ibraaheema fee Rabbiheee an aataahullaahul mulka iz qaala Ibraaheemu Rabbiyal lazee yuhyee wa yumeetu qaala ana uhyee wa umeetu qaala Ibraaheemu fa innal laaha yaatee bishshamsi minal mashriqi faati bihaa minal maghribi fabuhital lazee kafar; wallaahu laa yahdil qawmaz zaalimeen\nEnglish Translation:\"Have you not considered the one who argued with Abraham about his Lord [merely] because Allah had given him kingship?

Abu Huraira reported from Allah's Messenger \ufdfa as saying:  The most wretched person in the sight of Allah on the Day of Resurrection and the worst person and target of His wrath would of the person who is called Malik al-Amlak (the King of Kings) for there is no king but Allah. [1]\nThis next hadith is very instructive in understanding Allah's power and dominion. Abu Dharr reported Allah's Messenger \ufdfa as saying that Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, said: [2]\n\"O My servants, I have forbidden oppression for Myself and have made it forbidden amongst you, so do not oppress one another. \nO My servants, all of you are astray except for those I have guided, so seek guidance of Me and I shall guide you,\n O My servants, all of you are hungry except for those I have fed, so seek food of Me and I shall feed you. \nO My servants, all of you are naked except for those I have clothed, so seek clothing of Me and I shall clothe you. \nO My servants, you sin by night and by day, and I forgive all sins, so seek forgiveness of Me and I shall forgive you. \nO My servants, you will not attain harming Me so as to harm Me, and will not attain benefitting Me so as to benefit Me. \nO My servants, were the first of you and the last of you, the human of you and the jinn of you to be as pious as the most pious heart of any one man of you, that would not increase My dominion in anything. \nO My servants, were the first of you and the last of you, the human of you and the jinn of you to be as wicked as the most wicked heart of any one man of you, that would not decrease My dominion in anything. \nO My servants, were the first of you and the last of you, the human of you and the jinn of you to rise up in one place and make a request of Me, and were I to give everyone what he requested, that would not decrease what I have, any more that a needle decreases the sea if put into it. \nO My servants, it is but your deeds that I record for you and then recompense you for.

The meaning of j-l-l: to be supremely great to be glorious, majestic to be sublime to be high, lofty, far above, independent. k-r-m: to be noble, high minded, generous, to be highly esteemed, honored, prized, valued, to be excellent, precious, valuable, rare, to be productive, fruitful, bountiful.\nYou may find various translations of this name, and it stems from the interpretations of what Jalal and Ikram mean. Dhul (The Lord or Possessor), Jalal (Majesty or Glory), wal (and), Ikram, which comes from Karam (Generosity or Honor - similar to the name Al-Kareem). So, together we often see the Lord of Majesty and Honor, The Lord of Bounty and Honor, Lord of Majesty and Generosity.

From 26-27, it marks the transition to the blessings of the afterlife, \"Everyone upon the earth will perish, And there will remain the Face of your Lord, Owner of Majesty and Honor.\" Imam Bayhaqi mentions, \"As for Allah's face, we affirm it is an attribute of Allah, not as a form or image.\" Rather wajh is often interpreted as a \"face\" to represent His essence of having attributes of majesty and honor.\nWhat has also been said is the order of these two qualities. We must first recognize His Majesty, which encompasses many of His attributes, power, strength, judgment, knowledge, and absolute dominion. This could be classified as first studying and developing Taqwa (often described as God-consciousness or God-fearing piety), then we should study His grace (attributes of kindness, mercy, and forgiveness).\n\n\nReflection:If we only realize His loving and merciful attributes, we may rationalize or be easily tempted by bad behaviors. But if we recognize His power and strength, we would avoid things out of fear of displeasing Him. This is a back-and-forth between reverence and seeking repentance from His attributes of love and mercy.\n It was reported that Umar bin Khattab asked Ubayy ibn Ka'b about Taqwa. Ubay said, \"Have you ever walked on a path that has thorns on it?\" Umar said, \"Yes.\" Ubayy asked, \"What did you do then?\" to which Umar replied, \"I rolled up my sleeves and struggled.\" Ubayy said, \"That is taqwa, to protect oneself from sin through life's dangerous journey so that one can successfully complete the journey unscathed by sin.\" [1]\nA'isha (ra) reported: When the Messenger of Allah \ufdfa pronounced salutation, he salutation longer than it took him to say: [2]\n\u0627\u0644\u0644\u0651\u064e\u0647\u064f\u0645\u0651\u064e \u0623\u064e\u0646\u0652\u062a\u064e \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0651\u064e\u0644\u0627\u064e\u0645\u064f \u0648\u064e\u0645\u0650\u0646\u0652\u0643\u064e \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0651\u064e\u0644\u0627\u064e\u0645\u064f \u062a\u064e\u0628\u064e\u0627\u0631\u064e\u0643\u0652\u062a\u064e \u0630\u064e\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0652\u062c\u064e\u0644\u0627\u064e\u0644\u0650 \u0648\u064e\u0627\u0644\u0625\u0650\u0643\u0652\u0631\u064e\u0627\u0645\u0650\nAllahumma antas salam wa minkas salam tabarakta dhal jalali wal ikram\nEnglish Translation:\"O Allah: Thou art Peace, and peace comes from Thee, blessed art Thou, Possessor of Glory and Honour\"\nNarrated Anas ibn Malik: I was sitting with the Messenger of Allah \ufdfa and a man was offering prayer.

Indeed, Allah loves those who act justly.\" \u2014 (Qur'an 60:8)\nSeeking justice for when you are wrong:Much has already been said in the previous names regarding seeking Allah's forgiveness for our sins and ways in which we may have been deficient. But we may also benefit by looking at those we may have hurt and seeking their forgiveness directly.\nNarrated Abu Huraira: Allah's Messenger \ufdfa said, \"Whoever has wronged his brother, should ask for his pardon (before his death), as (in the Hereafter) there will be neither a Dinar nor a Dirham. (He should secure pardon in this life) before some of his good deeds are taken and paid to his brother, or, if he has done no good deeds, some of the bad deeds of his brother are taken to be loaded on him (in the Hereafter). [1]\nThe simple principle we should try applying in our life is to deal with people the way you would like Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 to deal with you. A person may have wronged you terribly, and you're confident you'll win this case on the day of judgment. But what about the thousands of cases others may have against you? What kind of precedent would you like established on the day of resurrection? No one can genuinely achieve Jannah on the basis of their deeds alone. Whatever we do will never be enough for us to confidently say we are deserving of paradise. Jannah is only achieved by Allah's grace and mercy. And so, what's best for the believer is to sincerely find it in their hearts to forgive and let go of the pain others may have caused. In doing so, you open yourself to receiving Allah's mercy.\nFrom the hadith, \"none can enter Paradise through his good deeds. They (the Prophet's companions) said, 'Not even you, O Allah's Messenger (\ufdfa)?' He said, \"Not even myself, unless Allah bestows His favor and mercy on me.\" [2]\nReferences:\n[1] Sahih al-Bukhari 6534\n[2] Sahih al-Bukhari 5673\n\n\n",

Of the 99 names, 81 are explicitly mentioned in the Qur'an. Therefore, there is not one agreed-upon list for the remaining 18 names. Al-Jami is one of those names which is not included by certain scholars. This list includes Ibn al-Wazir, Ibn Hazm, and Ibn al-Uthaymeen. However, others, such as Ibn Arabi, Imam al-Bayhaqi, and al-Ghazali, have included this name in their books of explanations of Asma ul-Husna.\nThe Gatherer:The word Jami is derived from Jama'a, which means to collect or gather.

He is The Gatherer. He has the power to combine all things, whether similar or dissimilar, both in space and time. He brought together human beings, infused them with a spirit, and put them on earth. We can go further by analyzing the details of a single creation, the human body. Its composition is complex, consisting of many layers all working as one, circulatory system (blood, veins, arteries...), digestive system (teeth, saliva, stomach...), nervous system (brain, spine, nerves...), and the list goes on.

            "mentions-from-quran-hadith": "\n\nArabic Root:From the root ghayn-nun-ya (\u063a \u0646 \u064a), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to be free from wants or needs, to be self-sufficient, independent, to be able to do without help from others, to be content, satisfied to be rich, wealthy, flourishing.\nThe name of Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 Al-Ghani, the rich or wealthy. This is one of the names of Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 from the Qur'an as it is mentioned 18 times. It is often explained in pairs with Al-Mughni (The Enricher) for its closeness in meaning. But just as a note to self, Al-Mughni is one of the names where there isn't a consensus as being accepted as an official name of Allah as it's not mentioned in the Qur'an.\nThe word ghni (\u063a\u0652\u0646\u0650\u064a\u064e) is often said to imply rich or wealthy. In the Qur'an, \"Allah has certainly heard the statement of those [Jews] who said, innal laaha faqeerunw wa nahnu aghniyaaa \"Indeed, Allah is poor, while we are rich.\" (Qur'an 3:181). In a hadith qudsi, the Prophet Muhammad \ufdfa related Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 as saying, \"[...] O My servants, were the first of you and the last of you, the human of you and the jinn of you to rise up in one place and make a request of Me, and were I to give everyone what he requested, that would not decrease what I have, any more that a needle decreases the sea if put into it.\"[1] This is how vast Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 wealth is. If every creation, human and jinn, both past, and present, were to ask Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 their innermost desire, and He was to give it to you, it would deplete Him as much as if you were to dip a needle in the ocean and try and remove some water with it. This is how rich Al-Ghaniyy is. His ability to provide is non-diminishable.\nLiving the rich life:Now, if you were to ask Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 to gift you with a rich life, what would that mean? One dimension may include monetary success. But if that's all you care about, you'll have missed the aim of what a truly rich life is. Imagine a person who's been given wealth by Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 but with it a short lifespan, health problems, minimal love and support from friends or family, with limited capacity to think and reason. Would you say they are living a rich life? Their wish will have been wasted as they haven't even considered the purpose of their existence, which is to glorify and worship Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670. They'll go through their entire life aimlessly, and on the day of resurrection, they'll be lost.\nThis is to illustrate that when we refer to Al-Ghani as rich, we don't mean in one aspect. But rather, He is abundant in all respects (i.e., knowledge, power, influence, might, time, etc.) In this light, we can see why Al-Ghaniy is often translated as 'The Self-Sufficient.'

He's provided for us, and we are not aware. We are not satiated by the things we possess. This is the curse of shaitan to look for the next thing, then the next thing, and after that, there is something else for us to fixate on. We are only finished chasing when we have reached our graves. This was the promise of Iblees. He vowed to make man ungrateful after his refusal to bow down to Adam (as), \"Then I will come to them from before them and from behind them and on their right and on their left, and You will not find most of them grateful [to You].\" (Qur'an 7:17) In the prophetic traditions of Muhammad \ufdfa, you will find the best example of behavior. He never praised food or drink. He would express gratitude towards the one who prepared it. Abu Sa'id al-Khudri told that when God\u2019s messenger finished his food he said, \"Praise be to God who has given us food and drink and made us Muslims.\" [2] and also, Anas said, \"When the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, went to bed, he said, 'Praise be to Allah who has given us food and drink, and given us enough and given us refuge. How many people have neither enough nor refuge!'\" [3] This is what it means to be cognizant of Allah's blessings.\nNothing can stand on human ambition and ability alone, we may be deluded to think so, but all success comes from Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670.

The balance is that we should be careful to not be ungrateful or unsatisfied with the gifts He has already given us. Be deliberate in your worldly desires.

But if you only want something out of greed, pride, or to rise in social rankings, we should think twice about its importance. What would be best for the believer is to live a life of detachment just as Prophet Muhammad \ufdfa did.

To make us sufficient in our relationships, not desiring anything outside that has been forbidden.\nA look into how the Prophet \ufdfa lived:In one of the longer hadith narrations, Umar bin Al-Khattab was said to visit the Prophet Muhammad \ufdfa in his house, and what he saw made him cry. \"Why are you weeping?' Umar replied, \"O Allah's Messenger \ufdfa! Caesar and Khosrau are leading the life (i.e., Luxurious life) while you, Allah's Messenger \ufdfa though you are, is living in destitute\". The Prophet \ufdfa then replied, 'Won't you be satisfied that they enjoy this world and we the Hereafter?'\" [5] Umar in the hadith describes the poverty-stricken lifestyle of Prophet Muhammad \ufdfa in the hadith. He entered the home of Prophet Muhammad \ufdfa to find him lying on a mat made of palm tree leaves. There was nothing to separate Prophet Muhammad \ufdfa from the mat. When he got off the mat, you could visibly see the branch marks it left on his body. When he saw these marks, Umar began to weep. Even as the economic conditions of the Muslims improved, the Prophet Muhammad \ufdfa stayed humble. Even in poverty, he \ufdfa was offered many bribes by Pagan leaders to abandon his campaign, and he always denied it because with Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 He was sufficient.\nReferences:\n[1] Sahih Muslim 2577a\n[2] Mishkat al-Masabih 4204\n[3] Sahih (Al-Albani) Al-Adab Al-Mufrad Book 50, Hadith 1206 \n[4] Hasan (Darussalam) Jami` at-Tirmidhi 3563\n[5] Sahih al-Bukhari 4913\n\n\n",

You should read the write-up for the name Al-Ghani to more deeply understand the name Al-Mughni. As a note, Al-Ghani is a name mentioned in the Qur'an 18 times, whereas scholars do not unanimously recognize Al-Mughni as it's not mentioned in the Qur'an.\nTo provide a quick summary, the name Al-Ghani implies that Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 is free from wants, independent, and self-sufficient. It's because of this nature of being fully satisfied and abundant that makes Him Al-Mughni, The Enricher. He is not only rich in a monetary sense but in all regards. He is the one needed and whose riches all others depend on. Now, Al-Mughni is the ultimate fulfiller of needs.\nHow to ask from Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670:There are two aspects of this, ask from Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 when you are needy. But to also not deny or belittle the blessings He's already given (see Al-Ghani for further clarification). There is a belief among scholars that there is a methodology or certain things a person can do to increase the chance of their du'a being fulfilled. Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 says in Surah Baqarah, \"[...] I respond to the invocation of the supplicant when he calls upon Me. So let them respond to Me [by obedience] and believe in Me that they may be [rightly] guided.\" (Qur'an 2:186) Allah is near to those who call upon Him, but He asks in return that we be obedient to what He has asked of us. This is part of the concept of tawassul. By increasing your nearness to Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 with actions beloved to Him, you increase the likelihood of obtaining His favor. After Prophet Zakariya (as) made du'a, we're told in the Qur'an, \"So We responded to him, and We gave to him John, and amended for him his wife. Indeed, they used to hasten to good deeds and supplicate Us in hope and fear, and they were to Us humbly submissive.\" (Qur'an 21:90)\nAnother shift we can make is going from an egocentric view to making a du'a in complete submission to Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670. The idea is sometimes we make our du'a, and we only focus on the self. I need this, and I need that. Please make this happen. There is nothing wrong with this view, Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 is Al-Mughni, and there is nothing He can't do. But note in the du'a of Prophet Zakariya (as), \"My Lord, grant me from Yourself a good offspring. Indeed, You are the Hearer of supplication.\" (Qur'an 3:38) and also, \"My Lord, do not leave me alone [with no heir], while you are the best of inheritors.\" (Qur'an 21:89) The importance is placed on seeking it from the one who can provide you it. Both du'as begin with exalting Him, Rabbanna \"My Lord,\" all things come from yourself, so grant me this, you're the hearer of supplication, you're the best of inheritors, so provide for me.\n \u0623\u064e\u0645\u0651\u064e\u0646 \u064a\u064f\u062c\u0650\u064a\u0628\u064f \u0671\u0644\u0652\u0645\u064f\u0636\u0652\u0637\u064e\u0631\u0651\u064e \u0625\u0650\u0630\u064e\u0627 \u062f\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0627\u0647\u064f \u0648\u064e\u064a\u064e\u0643\u0652\u0634\u0650\u0641\u064f \u0671\u0644\u0633\u0651\u064f\u0648\u0653\u0621\u064e \u0648\u064e\u064a\u064e\u062c\u0652\u0639\u064e\u0644\u064f\u0643\u064f\u0645\u0652 \u062e\u064f\u0644\u064e\u0641\u064e\u0627\u0653\u0621\u064e \u0671\u0644\u0652\u0623\u064e\u0631\u0652\u0636\u0650 \u06d7 \u0623\u064e\u0621\u0650\u0644\u064e\u0640\u0670\u0647\u064c\u06ed \u0645\u0651\u064e\u0639\u064e \u0671\u0644\u0644\u0651\u064e\u0647\u0650 \u06da \u0642\u064e\u0644\u0650\u064a\u0644\u064b\u06ed\u0627 \u0645\u0651\u064e\u0627 \u062a\u064e\u0630\u064e\u0643\u0651\u064e\u0631\u064f\u0648\u0646\u064e\n \u0623\u064e\u0645\u0651\u064e\u0646 \u064a\u064e\u0647\u0652\u062f\u0650\u064a\u0643\u064f\u0645\u0652 \u0641\u0650\u0649 \u0638\u064f\u0644\u064f\u0645\u064e\u0640\u0670\u062a\u0650 \u0671\u0644\u0652\u0628\u064e\u0631\u0651\u0650 \u0648\u064e\u0671\u0644\u0652\u0628\u064e\u062d\u0652\u0631\u0650 \u0648\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0646 \u064a\u064f\u0631\u0652\u0633\u0650\u0644\u064f \u0671\u0644\u0631\u0651\u0650\u064a\u064e\u0640\u0670\u062d\u064e \u0628\u064f\u0634\u0652\u0631\u064b\u06e2\u0627 \u0628\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0646\u064e \u064a\u064e\u062f\u064e\u0649\u0652 \u0631\u064e\u062d\u0652\u0645\u064e\u062a\u0650\u0647\u0650\u06e6\u0653 \u06d7 \u0623\u064e\u0621\u0650\u0644\u064e\u0640\u0670\u0647\u064c\u06ed \u0645\u0651\u064e\u0639\u064e \u0671\u0644\u0644\u0651\u064e\u0647\u0650 \u06da \u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0640\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649 \u0671\u0644\u0644\u0651\u064e\u0647\u064f \u0639\u064e\u0645\u0651\u064e\u0627 \u064a\u064f\u0634\u0652\u0631\u0650\u0643\u064f\u0648\u0646\u064e\nAmmany-yujeebul mud tarra izaa da\u2019aahu wa yakshifus sooo\u2019a wa yaj\u2019alukum khula faaa\u2019al ardi \u2018a-ilaahun ma\u2019allah qaleelan maa tazak karoon Ammany-yahdeekum fee zulumaatil barri wal bahri wa many yursilu riyaaha bushran baina yadai rahmatih; \u2018a-ilaahun ma\u2019allah; Ta\u2019aalal laahu \u2018ammaa yushrikoon \nEnglish Translation:\"Is He [not best] who responds to the desperate one when he calls upon Him and removes evil and makes you inheritors of the earth? Is there a deity with Allah? Little do you remember. Is He [not best] who guides you through the darknesses of the land and sea and who sends the winds as good tidings before His mercy? Is there a deity with Allah? High is Allah above whatever they associate with Him.\" \u2014 (Qur'an 27:62-63)\nBeing vulnerable in your du'a:We can also use our state or circumstance and say, \"Oh Allah, I am faqeer (\u0641\u0642\u06cc\u0631\u200e),\" meaning from poverty or in a dire state. From this ayah, we learn that Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 loves to respond to the desperate cry of His believer. The subtle spiritual shift is from revolving around your needs to sincere submission and reliance upon Allah. Directing your heart in neediness to receive from Him and His beautiful attributes. Of course, following these criteria is not always necessary. Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 is most merciful and gives to whom He wills.

After escaping Egypt to avoid persecution, he traveled through the desert until he came across a group of male shepherds watering their flocks at a well. Keeping their distance, he noticed two women waiting in the back with their sheep. Why? For whatever reason, they felt safer waiting than mixing with the men who were gathered at the well. They explained to Musa (as) that their father was an older man and unable to feed their flock, so they had to take on this duty. Now, keep in mind that Musa (as) himself was disheveled and exhausted from his travels. He likely did not have much to eat or drink. Still, he empathized with the girls, \"So he watered (their flocks) for them; then he turned back to the shade\u2026.\" As he turned back to the shade, he recited the following du'a.\n \u0641\u064e\u0633\u064e\u0642\u064e\u0649\u0670 \u0644\u064e\u0647\u064f\u0645\u064e\u0627 \u062b\u064f\u0645\u0651\u064e \u062a\u064e\u0648\u064e\u0644\u0651\u064e\u0649\u0670\u0653 \u0625\u0650\u0644\u064e\u0649 \u0671\u0644\u0638\u0651\u0650\u0644\u0651\u0650 \u0641\u064e\u0642\u064e\u0627\u0644\u064e \u0631\u064e\u0628\u0651\u0650 \u0625\u0650\u0646\u0651\u0650\u064a \u0644\u0650\u0645\u064e\u0627\u0653 \u0623\u064e\u0646\u0632\u064e\u0644\u06e1\u062a\u064e \u0625\u0650\u0644\u064e\u064a\u0651\u064e \u0645\u0650\u0646\u06e1 \u062e\u064e\u064a\u06e1\u0631\u0656 \u0641\u064e\u0642\u0650\u064a\u0631\u065e\nFasaqaa lahumaa summa tawallaaa ilaz zilli faqaala Rabbi innee limaaa anzalta ilaiya min khairin faqeer\nEnglish Translation:\"So he watered [their flocks] for them; then he went back to the shade and said, 'My Lord, indeed I am, for whatever good You would send down to me, in need.'\" \u2014 (Qur'an 28:24)\nHe was in a dire state and made this plea before Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 to send down more good. He knew he was impoverished and saw that the opportunity which presented itself was a gift from Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 and he was in need of more. It's a beautiful du'a that asks from Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 but also keeps in mind the role we play as well.\nReflection:The ways in which the believer can try to connect with this name is to spend their time busying themselves in the service to others. You can enrich your soul by trying to enrich the lives of others. Shaykh Tosun Bayrak wrote, \"become an instrument of satisfying the needs of the needy\" in both the realms of the material and spiritual. We can see this quality through the stories told about Prophet Muhammad \ufdfa.\nJabir b. Abdullah reported: It never happened that Allah's Messenger \ufdfa was asked for anything, and he said: No. [1] The Prophet Muhammad \ufdfa character was perfect. Whenever someone came to him asking for help, he could not find in his heart to turn them away. He would spend his time being of service, which is part of what made him so loved among the companions. He was there for them, and they knew it.\nAnas b. Malik (ra) reported: I served the Messenger of Allah \ufdfa for ten years, and, by Allah, he never said to me any harsh word, and he never said to me about a thing as to why I had done that and as to why I had not done that. [2] The Prophet \ufdfa never tried to spread negativity, hatred, or curse those around him. He never questioned why Anas ibn Malik (ra) did something or did not do something. This does not mean he was passive, either. All we can infer from this is the supreme leadership skills he possessed.\nWhat reputation follows us? How would someone speak of working with you after spending ten years together? Did you try to uplift others? Were you supportive? Or would they say you complained frequently and brought everyone down?\nWe can never be truly devoid of needs; we are human beings with desires and needs. But as mentioned in Al-Ghani, we can work on being deliberate in our worldly desires. If it benefits you, then ask of Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 who is Al-Ghani and Al-Mughni. But if you only want something out of greed, pride, or to rise in social rankings, we should think twice about its importance. It's possible to have 1 million dollars and still believe you don't have enough. You may have friends who have boats and multi-million dollar mansions, making you feel less than. This is why it's been famously said it is not greed that drives the world but envy. Today, we have fridges, cars, video games, computers, phones, and on-demand food delivery service. The average person is living better than kings a thousand years ago. But do you feel like a king? In Al-Ghani, we mentioned how Umar (ra) cried when he saw how the Prophet \ufdfa was living. This house had one bed, a few cloth and pots, black curtains, water skins that hung above his bed, and an uncomfortable mat that left marks on his body. When Prophet Muhammad \ufdfa was asked about this, \"Won't you be satisfied that they enjoy this world and we the Hereafter?\" So it is possible we have been enriched by Al-Mughni and not even realized it.\nAli (ra) narrated: that a Mukatib came to him and said: \"Indeed I am not capable of my Kitabah so aid me.\" He said: \"Should I not teach you words that the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) taught me? If you had a debt upon you similar to the mountain of Sir, Allah would fulfill it for you.\" He said: [3]\n\u0627\u0644\u0644\u0651\u064e\u0647\u064f\u0645\u0651\u064e \u0627\u0643\u0652\u0641\u0650\u0646\u0650\u064a \u0628\u0650\u062d\u064e\u0644\u0627\u064e\u0644\u0650\u0643\u064e \u0639\u064e\u0646\u0652 \u062d\u064e\u0631\u064e\u0627\u0645\u0650\u0643\u064e \u0648\u064e\u0623\u064e\u063a\u0652\u0646\u0650\u0646\u0650\u064a \u0628\u0650\u0641\u064e\u0636\u0652\u0644\u0650\u0643\u064e \u0639\u064e\u0645\u0651\u064e\u0646\u0652 \u0633\u0650\u0648\u064e\u0627\u0643\u064e\nAllahummakfini bihalalika `an haramika, wa aghnini bi fadlika `amman siwaka\nEnglish Translation:\"O Allah, suffice me with Your lawful against Your prohibited, and make me independent of all those besides You\"\nReferences:\n[1] Sahih Muslim 2311a\n[2] Sahih al-Bukhari 6038 and Sahih Muslim 2309d\n[3] Hasan (Darussalam) Jami` at-Tirmidhi 3563\n\n\n",

            "description": "The Shielder, The Protector, The Preventer.",
            "mentions-from-quran-hadith": "\n\nArabic Root:From the root mim-nun-ayn (\u0645 \u0646 \u0639), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to prevent, hinder, hold back, restrain, deny, impede, resist, forbid, refuse, prohibit, to guard, defend, or to protect.\nAmong the disputed names:The name of Allah, Al-Mani, The Protector. As we've mentioned in previous names, different scholars have different criteria for what qualifies as a name of Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670. Of the 99 names, 81 are explicitly mentioned in the Qur'an. Therefore, there is not one agreed-upon list for the remaining 18 names. Al-Mani is one of those names that certain scholars do not include. This list includes Ibn al-Wazir, Ibn Hazm, and Ibn al-Uthaymeen, among others. However, others, such as Ibn Arabi, Imam al-Bayhaqi, and al-Ghazali, have included this name in their lists.\nAl-Mani is the one who gives and the one who withholds. When He gives, nothing can come in its way to prevent it. If he decides to withhold, no one can substitute and give it instead. Al-Hafeedh (The Protector) and Al-Qabid (The Restricting) are similar in meaning to this name. As we mention in the name Al-Qabid, Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 can give and prevent for whomever. Whatever Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 wills is good since it's from Him. He can dispose of His dominion however He wishes. It is not up to us to judge whether a thing is good or bad. And He's not limited in what He can do; this goes back to the attributes of power, control, and supreme authority. He is Al-Wahhab (The Bestower of Gifts) and the opposite in meaning Al-Mani (The Preventer).

We can look to see the many blessings already bestowed by His quality of being Al-Khaliq, Al-Wahhab, and Ar-Razzaq. He created us, gave us the gift of life, and continues to provide sustenance in every moment.

            "mentions-from-quran-hadith": "\n\nArabic Root:From the root dad-ra-ra (\u0636 \u0631 \u0631), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to have an opinion that is opposing, to apply forceful correction, to do an act that is disliked making inconvenient, annoy, distress, to cause adversity, afflict, to harm, injure, and hurt.\nAmong the disputed names:As we've mentioned in previous names, different scholars have different criteria for what qualifies as a name of Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670. Of the 99 names, 81 are explicitly mentioned in the Qur'an. Therefore, there is not one agreed-upon list for the remaining 18 names. Adh-Darr & An-Nafi are among those names which are not included by certain scholars. This list includes Ibn al-Wazir, Ibn Hazm, and Ibn al-Uthaymeen, among others. However, others, such as Ibn Arabi, Imam al-Bayhaqi, and Imam al-Ghazali, have included these names in their lists.\nComplimentary Devine Names:The names Al-Nafi and Ad-Darr (The one who benefits and The one who harms) are often explained in pairs to acknowledge their opposing nature. To explain each name in isolation is to break the harmony and provide an inaccurate or less comprehensive depiction of who Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 is. The same is true of Al-Qabid (The Restrictor) and Al-Basit (The Expander), Al-Awwal (The First) and Al-Akhir (The Last).\nDuality of good and evil:All things come from Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670, but the proper prescribed Islamic etiquette (Adab - good manners) is to not attribute evil with Allah. Yes, it is Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 who punishes the disobedient, and on the day of judgment, He passes His verdict on whether we will attain paradise. We should be fearful and wish to avoid His punishment. This is part of having taqwa. But let's not forget all His other attributes, how He is Al-Hakam (The Impartial Judge) and Al-Adl (The Embodiment of Justice). Imam Zarruq writes of Ad-Darr and An-Nafi, \"He is the One who decrees harm and benefit, and who causes either of the two to reach whoever He wills in whichever manner He wills, justly in the case of the former, and out of bountiful favour in respect of the latter, and Allah knows best.\"\nI am doubtful many of us would opt into living in a real anarchist society without law enforcement or governing authority.

But if good comes to them, they say, \u201cThis is from Allah \u201c; and if evil befalls them, they say, \u201cThis is from you.\u201d Say, \u201cAll [things] are from Allah.\u201d So what is [the matter] with those people that they can hardly understand any statement?\" \u2014 (Qur'an 4:78)\nIn another example, when Surah An-Nisa Ayah 123 was revealed to the Prophet Muhammad \ufdfa, it worried the sahabah. Abu Bakr asked Prophet Muhammad \ufdfa about this verse:  O Messenger of Allah, how could we be in a good state after this verse: \"It will not be in accordance with your desires, nor those of the people of the Scripture, whosoever works evil, will have the recompense thereof (4:123)? Will we be punished for every bad deed we do? There Messenger of Allah \ufdfa said: \"May Allah forgive you, O Abu Bakr, do you not fall sick? Do you not get exhausted? Do you not feel sad? Don't calamities befall you?\" He said: Of course. He said: \"That is the recompense you are given.\" [1]\nSo what we learn from this is Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 is Ad-Darr (the one who causes harm), but it is never senseless or without benefit. Remember, Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 is also Al-Haleem (Forbearing) and As-Sabur (Patient). So, often what is best for the believer is to ask for forgiveness and to be steadfast and perseverant if faced with difficulties.\n\n\nIbrahim (as) and the fire:Imam al-Ghazali mentions that anything that happens (good or bad) does not occur without the will of Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670. The example Imam al-Ghazali gives is not to suppose \"poison kills or harms by itself, or that food satisfies or benefits by itself; or that kings or men or Satan, or any creature - be they heavenly bodies or stars or anything else are capable of good or evil, benefit or harm, by themselves.\" All that happens is because of the will of Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670. He's allowed for the medicine to cure, the poison to harm, and for Iblees and mankind to exist. Another example of this is fire. It is neither good nor bad, but Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 makes it so. When Nimrod threatened to kill Ibrahim (as) he threw him into the fire, \"Allah said, 'O fire, be coolness and safety upon Abraham.' And they intended for him harm, but We made them the greatest losers.\" (Qur'an 21:69-70) To a person who has the support of Al-Nafi (The Benefactor), nothing can harm them.\nReflection:And so, the believer benefits from knowing these two names of Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670. We further recognize that it is only Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 who has absolute power to benefit or cause harm. When you're stricken with fear, sickness, or poverty, know that it is from Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 and only He can dispel it.

The next name in this series is al-Nurr.X \nArabic Root:From the root nun-fa-ayn (\u0646 \u0641 \u0639), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to profit, to be of use, to be beneficial, useful to have the use of something.\nAs an aside, as we've mentioned in previous names, different scholars have different criteria for what qualifies as a name of Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670. Of the 99 names, 81 are explicitly mentioned in the Qur'an. Therefore, there is not one agreed-upon list for the remaining 18 names. Adh-Darr & An-Nafi are among those names which are not included by certain scholars. This list includes Ibn al-Wazir, Ibn Hazm, and Ibn al-Uthaymeen, among others. However, others, such as Ibn Arabi, Imam al-Bayhaqi, and Imam al-Ghazali, have included these names in their lists.\nComplimentary Devine Names:The names Al-Nafi and Ad-Darr (The one who benefits and The one who harms) are often explained in pairs to acknowledge their opposing nature. To explain each name in isolation is to break the harmony and provide an inaccurate or less comprehensive depiction of who Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 is. The same is true of Al-Qabid (The Restrictor) and Al-Basit (The Expander), Al-Awwal (The First) and Al-Akhir (The Last).\nDuality of good and evil:All things come from Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670, but the proper prescribed Islamic etiquette (Adab - good manners) is to not attribute evil with Allah. Yes, it is Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 who punishes the disobedient, and on the day of judgment, He passes His verdict on whether we will attain paradise. We should be fearful and wish to avoid His punishment. This is part of having taqwa. But let's not forget all His other attributes, how He is Al-Hakam (The Impartial Judge) and Al-Adl (The Embodiment of Justice). Imam Zarruq writes of Ad-Darr and An-Nafi, \"He is the One who decrees harm and benefit, and who causes either of the two to reach whoever He wills in whichever manner He wills, justly in the case of the former, and out of bountiful favour in respect of the latter, and Allah knows best.\"\nI am doubtful many of us would opt into living in a real anarchist society without law enforcement or governing authority. That an individual is free to do whatever they prefer. Similarly, Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 is the ruling governing body over this world and the hereafter.

But if good comes to them, they say, \u201cThis is from Allah \u201c; and if evil befalls them, they say, \u201cThis is from you.\u201d Say, \u201cAll [things] are from Allah.\u201d So what is [the matter] with those people that they can hardly understand any statement?\" \u2014 (Qur'an 4:78)\nIn another example, when Surah An-Nisa Ayah 123 was revealed to the Prophet Muhammad \ufdfa, it worried the sahabah. Abu Bakr asked Prophet Muhammad \ufdfa about this verse:  O Messenger of Allah, how could we be in a good state after this verse: \"It will not be in accordance with your desires, nor those of the people of the Scripture, whosoever works evil, will have the recompense thereof (4:123)? Will we be punished for every bad deed we do? There Messenger of Allah \ufdfa said: \"May Allah forgive you, O Abu Bakr, do you not fall sick? Do you not get exhausted? Do you not feel sad? Don't calamities befall you?\" He said: Of course. He said: \"That is the recompense you are given.\" [1]\nSo what we learn from this is Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 is Ad-Darr (the one who causes harm), but it is never senseless or without benefit. Remember, Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 is also Al-Haleem (Forbearing) and As-Sabur (Patient). So, often what is best for the believer is to ask for forgiveness and to be steadfast and perseverant if faced with difficulties.\n\n\nIbrahim (as) and the fire:Imam al-Ghazali mentions that anything that happens (good or bad) does not occur without the will of Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670. The example Imam al-Ghazali gives is not to suppose \"poison kills or harms by itself, or that food satisfies or benefits by itself; or that kings or men or Satan, or any creature - be they heavenly bodies or stars or anything else are capable of good or evil, benefit or harm, by themselves.\" All that happens is because of the will of Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670. He's allowed for the medicine to cure, the poison to harm, and for Iblees and mankind to exist. Another example of this is fire. It is neither good nor bad, but Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 makes it so. When Nimrod threatened to kill Ibrahim (as) he threw him into the fire, \"Allah said, 'O fire, be coolness and safety upon Abraham.' And they intended for him harm, but We made them the greatest losers.\" (Qur'an 21:69-70) To a person who has the support of Al-Nafi (The Benefactor), nothing can harm them.\nReflection:And so, the believer benefits from knowing these two names of Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670. We further recognize that it is only Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 who has absolute power to benefit or cause harm. When you're stricken with fear, sickness, or poverty, know that it is from Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 and only He can dispel it. When blessed with happiness, wealth, or good health, it is from Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670, and only He can sustain it.\nWe must further reflect upon our lives and ask ourselves what things are causing us harm mentally, spiritually, and physically. Once identified, seek to limit or eliminate. Alternatively, be conscious and seek things that benefit you. Find ways to incorporate them and make them part of your daily routine. Be grateful and thankful to Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 for allowing these blessings, as we must realize it is all from Him.\n \u0648\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0627 \u062a\u064e\u062f\u06e1\u0639\u064f \u0645\u0650\u0646 \u062f\u064f\u0648\u0646\u0650 \u0671\u0644\u0644\u0651\u064e\u0647\u0650 \u0645\u064e\u0627 \u0644\u064e\u0627 \u064a\u064e\u0646\u0641\u064e\u0639\u064f\u0643\u064e \u0648\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0627 \u064a\u064e\u0636\u064f\u0631\u0651\u064f\u0643\u064e\u06d6 \u0641\u064e\u0625\u0650\u0646 \u0641\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0644\u06e1\u062a\u064e \u0641\u064e\u0625\u0650\u0646\u0651\u064e\u0643\u064e \u0625\u0650\u0630\u0657\u0627 \u0645\u0651\u0650\u0646\u064e \u0671\u0644\u0638\u0651\u064e\u0640\u0670\u0644\u0650\u0645\u0650\u064a\u0646\u064e\nWa laa tad\u2019u min doonil laahi maa laa yanfa\u2019uka wa laa yadurruk; fa in fa\u2019alta fa innaka izam minaz zaalimeen\nEnglish Translation:\"And do not invoke besides Allah that which neither benefits you nor harms you, for if you did, then indeed you would be of the wrongdoers.'\" \u2014 (Qur'an 10:106)\n \u0642\u064f\u0644\u06e1 \u0623\u064e\u0646\u064e\u062f\u06e1\u0639\u064f\u0648\u0627\u0652 \u0645\u0650\u0646 \u062f\u064f\u0648\u0646\u0650 \u0671\u0644\u0644\u0651\u064e\u0647\u0650 \u0645\u064e\u0627 \u0644\u064e\u0627 \u064a\u064e\u0646\u0641\u064e\u0639\u064f\u0646\u064e\u0627 \u0648\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0627 \u064a\u064e\u0636\u064f\u0631\u0651\u064f\u0646\u064e\u0627 \u0648\u064e\u0646\u064f\u0631\u064e\u062f\u0651\u064f \u0639\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670\u0653 \u0623\u064e\u0639\u06e1\u0642\u064e\u0627\u0628\u0650\u0646\u064e\u0627 \u0628\u064e\u0639\u06e1\u062f\u064e \u0625\u0650\u0630\u06e1 \u0647\u064e\u062f\u064e\u0649\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0627 \u0671\u0644\u0644\u0651\u064e\u0647\u064f \u0643\u064e\u0671\u0644\u0651\u064e\u0630\u0650\u064a \u0671\u0633\u06e1\u062a\u064e\u0647\u06e1\u0648\u064e\u062a\u06e1\u0647\u064f \u0671\u0644\u0634\u0651\u064e\u064a\u064e\u0670\u0637\u0650\u064a\u0646\u064f \u0641\u0650\u064a \u0671\u0644\u06e1\u0623\u064e\u0631\u06e1\u0636\u0650 \u062d\u064e\u064a\u06e1\u0631\u064e\u0627\u0646\u064e \u0644\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5\u0653 \u0623\u064e\u0635\u06e1\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0628\u065e \u064a\u064e\u062f\u06e1\u0639\u064f\u0648\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5\u0653 \u0625\u0650\u0644\u064e\u0649 \u0671\u0644\u06e1\u0647\u064f\u062f\u064e\u0649 \u0671\u0626\u06e1\u062a\u0650\u0646\u064e\u0627\u06d7 \u0642\u064f\u0644\u06e1 \u0625\u0650\u0646\u0651\u064e \u0647\u064f\u062f\u064e\u0649 \u0671\u0644\u0644\u0651\u064e\u0647\u0650 \u0647\u064f\u0648\u064e \u0671\u0644\u06e1\u0647\u064f\u062f\u064e\u0649\u0670\u06d6 \u0648\u064e\u0623\u064f\u0645\u0650\u0631\u06e1\u0646\u064e\u0627 \u0644\u0650\u0646\u064f\u0633\u06e1\u0644\u0650\u0645\u064e \u0644\u0650\u0631\u064e\u0628\u0651\u0650 \u0671\u0644\u06e1\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0645\u0650\u064a\u0646\u064e\nQul anad\u2019oo min doonil laahi maa laa yanfa\u2019unaa wa laa yadurrunaa wa nuraddu \u2018alaaa a\u2019qaabina ba\u2019da iz hadaanal laahu kallazis tahwat hush Shayaateenu fil ardi hairaana lahooo ashaabuny yad\u2019oo nahooo ilal huda\u2019 tinaa; qul inna hudal laahi huwal hudaa wa umirnaa linuslima li Rabbil \u2018aalameen\nEnglish Translation:Say, \"Shall we invoke instead of Allah that which neither benefits us nor harms us and be turned back on our heels after Allah has guided us?

The deeds in the night are taken up to Him before the deeds of the day, and the deeds of the day before the deeds of the night. His veil is the light. In the hadith narrated by Abu Bakr (instead of the word \"light\"), it is fire. If he withdraws it (the veil), the splendor of His countenance would consume His creation so far as His sight reaches. [1]\nMusa (as) was the only Prophet to have spoken with Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670, and in his conversation, He asked if he could see him, \"And when Moses arrived at Our appointed time and his Lord spoke to him, he said, \"My Lord, show me [Yourself] that I may look at You.\" [Allah] said, \"You will not see Me, but look at the mountain; if it should remain in place, then you will see Me.\" But when his Lord appeared to the mountain, He rendered it level, and Moses fell unconscious. And when he awoke, he said, 'Exalted are You! I have repented to You, and I am the first of the believers.'\" Qur'an 7:143 So we learn that Allah's light is too powerful to be witnessed, \"Vision perceives Him not, but He perceives [all] vision; and He is the Subtle, the Acquainted.\" (Qur'an 6:103)\nThe Various Interpretations:It may be obvious, but worth mentioning. When we say Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 is Al-Nur (The Light), it is not meant in the literal sense. The light we see is created and is not eternal. It gets emitted, absorbed, reflected, and refracted. Most scholars agree for it to be a name and attribute of Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 it must be understood by the consequence and the properties of light. Light illuminates, makes things visible, and shows the way through the darkness. This leads to many interpretations of the name An-Nur which we'll explore in detail.\nThe first understanding is through His ability to manifest creation. Darkness is the absence of light; when we have no light, what remains is darkness. Similarly, it can be said if something did not exist, it was hidden or unknown. Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 has the power to make them visible or known by creating them. It may seem paradoxical, but the natural state of existence is nothingness. We cannot fathom what absolute nothingness is, but that's the state from which all things come - it's the origin. People mistakenly assume that life is just the arrangement of atoms and molecules, but who created the atoms and molecules? Who was responsible for its perfect, orderly arrangement? What keeps everything going and allows them to remain? The only logical conclusion to this question is Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670. Without Him saying, kun fa-yakoon, \"Be, and it is!\" Qur'an 36:82, they would not be known.\nA second interpretation is light manifests; it makes things that are hidden - visible. His light operates at many levels. There is nothing that can be hidden from Him. He is the Al-Baseer (All-Seeing) and As-Sami (All-Hearing). His light reveals, and nothing escapes His view. \"And with Him are the keys of the unseen; none knows them except Him. And He knows what is on the land and in the sea. Not a leaf falls but that He knows it.\" (Qur'an 6:59)\nHe also illuminates mankind through His book and His Messengers (may peace be upon them). He's a guide to those lost. So, in this sense, He lights upon light. From the darkness of nonexistence to the light of existence, from unguided to guided.\n \u064a\u064e\u0640\u0670\u0653\u0623\u064e\u0647\u06e1\u0644\u064e \u0671\u0644\u06e1\u0643\u0650\u062a\u064e\u0670\u0628\u0650 \u0642\u064e\u062f\u06e1 \u062c\u064e\u0627\u0653\u0621\u064e\u0643\u064f\u0645\u06e1 \u0631\u064e\u0633\u064f\u0648\u0644\u064f\u0646\u064e\u0627 \u064a\u064f\u0628\u064e\u064a\u0651\u0650\u0646\u064f \u0644\u064e\u0643\u064f\u0645\u06e1 \u0643\u064e\u062b\u0650\u064a\u0631\u0657\u0627 \u0645\u0651\u0650\u0645\u0651\u064e\u0627 \u0643\u064f\u0646\u062a\u064f\u0645\u06e1 \u062a\u064f\u062e\u06e1\u0641\u064f\u0648\u0646\u064e \u0645\u0650\u0646\u064e \u0671\u0644\u06e1\u0643\u0650\u062a\u064e\u0670\u0628\u0650 \u0648\u064e\u064a\u064e\u0639\u06e1\u0641\u064f\u0648\u0627\u0652 \u0639\u064e\u0646 \u0643\u064e\u062b\u0650\u064a\u0631\u0656\u06da \u0642\u064e\u062f\u06e1 \u062c\u064e\u0627\u0653\u0621\u064e\u0643\u064f\u0645 \u0645\u0651\u0650\u0646\u064e \u0671\u0644\u0644\u0651\u064e\u0647\u0650 \u0646\u064f\u0648\u0631\u065e \u0648\u064e\u0643\u0650\u062a\u064e\u0670\u0628\u065e \u0645\u0651\u064f\u0628\u0650\u064a\u0646\u065e\nyaaa Ahlal kitaabi qad jaaa\u2019akum Rasoolunaa yubaiyinu lakum kaseeram mimmmaa kuntum tukhfoona minal Kitaabi wa ya\u2019foo \u2018an kaseer; qad jaaa\u2019akum minal laahi noorunw wa Kitaabum Mubeen\nEnglish Translation:\"O People of the Scripture, there has come to you Our Messenger making clear to you much of what you used to conceal of the Scripture and overlooking much. There has come to you from Allah a light and a clear Book.\" \u2014 (Qur'an 5:15)\nThe Darkness Within:Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 describes Himself in verse 35 of Surah Nur as the \"light of the heaven and the earth.\" Everything that comes from Him comes through His light. To contrast, Shaykh Tosun Bayrak mentions how \"the light of faith eliminates the darknesses of infidelity and sin within and without, bringing us to the light of Truth and salvation and serenity. The devil, and one's own devil, the ego, are those who like to operate in darkness and enter dark houses they will not enter that Divine house, the heart illuminated by the light of Faith.\"\nThe darkness in the believer is their ego.

By keeping ties of kinship, spreading peace, oppressing evils, gift-giving, feeding friends and neighbors, praying salah, remembering Him in our prayers, giving zakat to the needy, being patient, practicing gratitude, respecting and upholding the rights of parents, children, and women.

Guidance is sent through two means. The primary source for guidance is the literal word of Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670, and that is the Qur'an. The second form of guidance was given through His Prophets and the last Messenger, Prophet Muhammad \ufdfa. We study and learn from the Prophetic traditions (what he said and consistently did or encouraged). This is captured through his companions and is mentioned in the hadith book collections. Most notably, Sahih Bukhari, Sahih Muslim, Sunan at-Tirmidhi, Sunan-Ibn Majah, Sunan Abu-Dawud, Sunan Nasa'i.

From the Tafseer of Abul Ala Maududi, it mentions how the non-believers took this as an opportunity to mock and discredit Prophet Muhammad (\ufdfa), saying, \"...you wish that your clansmen and your kinsfolk; and your near and dear ones should benefit from this life-giving nectar.\"\nThe response Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 gives to Prophet Muhammad (\ufdfa) is that he is only but a mere guide.

Maududi concludes with the following remark for this ayah, \"He wills not on account of a family or tribal relationship, but on the basis of one's sincerity, capability and inclination of the heart.\" This is why when we make du'a, we ask Allah to increase our imaan (faith) and to make us among those who have the courage, intellect, and strength so that we can walk the straight path.\nDivine Guidance:The second interpretation of what it means for Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 to be referred to as Al-Hadi is expanded with the understanding of this ayah.\n \u0642\u064e\u0627\u0644\u064e \u0631\u064e\u0628\u0651\u064f\u0646\u064e\u0627 \u0671\u0644\u0651\u064e\u0630\u0650\u064a\u0653 \u0623\u064e\u0639\u06e1\u0637\u064e\u0649\u0670 \u0643\u064f\u0644\u0651\u064e \u0634\u064e\u064a\u06e1\u0621\u064d \u062e\u064e\u0644\u06e1\u0642\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u062b\u064f\u0645\u0651\u064e \u0647\u064e\u062f\u064e\u0649\u0670\nQaala Rabbunal lazeee a\u2019taa kulla shai\u2019in khalqahoo summa hadaa\nEnglish Translation:\"He said, 'Our Lord is He who gave each thing its form and then guided [it].'\" \u2014 (Qur'an 20:50)\nFrom this ayah, we can infer that Allah's guidance is not just an attribute of showing people the path of faith. It is more encompassing than that. Each creation has been divinely guided to what is required to satisfy its needs.\n Imam al-Ghazali writes of how an infant knows how to crawl up to the mother's breast and take milk without any intervention (a phenomenon known as \"the breast crawl\"). It's also why bees build their hives in a hexagonal pattern. It's the most efficient use of space. This shape is better than all others as it requires the least amount of wax to build, creates a compact structure, and leaves the most space for honey and rearing larvae. Everything has been perfectly guided and accounted for.\n \u0648\u064e\u0671\u0644\u0651\u064e\u0630\u0650\u0649 \u0642\u064e\u062f\u0651\u064e\u0631\u064e \u0641\u064e\u0647\u064e\u062f\u064e\u0649\u0670\nWallazee qaddara fahadaa\nEnglish Translation:\"And who destined and [then] guided\" \u2014 (Qur'an 87:3)\n\n\nReflection:We ask to become among those rightly guided. We realize in all our actions, there is an underlying motive, and that reason is to serve Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670. It is an expression of love and servitude. The reason why we pray five times per day, dietary \"restrictions,\" wearing the hijab, and keeping the beard. All of this is for Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670. We should keep this in mind and not forget the purpose of our actions. Don't just fall in love with the routine without thinking of the reason why. Avoid the mindset of doing things just for the sake of doing them. There's a deeper motive to it, and if it's understood, it will make the action sweeter. Remember, in all good that you do, it's to please Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670, to draw closer and strengthen our connection to Him. By realizing this, we may even begin asking upon doing something good if there was a manner in which the act could've been performed that would've been even more pleasing to Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670. This spurs curiosity and motivation to study the Prophetic traditions of Prophet Muhammad \ufdfa in all matters. In doing so, you become even more guided.\nTo characterize oneself by the name Al-Hadi, we ask whether we are good representatives or guides to encourage people to do what's better. The key is to facilitate, which means to make something easier. It does not mean demanding, scolding, judging, being negative, or making others feel miserable. We can even see how the message of Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 is explained in the Qur'an:\n \u0625\u0650\u0646\u0651\u064e \u0647\u064e\u0670\u0630\u064e\u0627 \u0671\u0644\u06e1\u0642\u064f\u0631\u06e1\u0621\u064e\u0627\u0646\u064e \u064a\u064e\u0647\u06e1\u062f\u0650\u064a \u0644\u0650\u0644\u0651\u064e\u062a\u0650\u064a \u0647\u0650\u064a\u064e \u0623\u064e\u0642\u06e1\u0648\u064e\u0645\u064f \u0648\u064e\u064a\u064f\u0628\u064e\u0634\u0651\u0650\u0631\u064f \u0671\u0644\u06e1\u0645\u064f\u0624\u06e1\u0645\u0650\u0646\u0650\u064a\u0646\u064e \u0671\u0644\u0651\u064e\u0630\u0650\u064a\u0646\u064e \u064a\u064e\u0639\u06e1\u0645\u064e\u0644\u064f\u0648\u0646\u064e \u0671\u0644\u0635\u0651\u064e\u0640\u0670\u0644\u0650\u062d\u064e\u0670\u062a\u0650 \u0623\u064e\u0646\u0651\u064e \u0644\u064e\u0647\u064f\u0645\u06e1 \u0623\u064e\u062c\u06e1\u0631\u0657\u0627 \u0643\u064e\u0628\u0650\u064a\u0631\u0657\u0627\nInna haazal Quraana yahdee lillatee hiya aqwamu wa yubashshirul mu\u2019mineenal lazeena ya\u2019maloonas saalihaati anna lahum ajran kabeeraa\nEnglish Translation:\"Indeed, this Qur\u2019an guides to that which is most suitable and gives good tidings to the believers who do righteous deeds that they will have a great reward.\" \u2014 (Qur'an 17:9)\nIt mentions that the Qur'an has been sent to protect noble/upright character.

To encourage good acts, educate, show, explain, and make something as easy as possible to follow.\nNarrated Uthman bin Affan: The Prophet \ufdfa said, \"The most superior among you (Muslims) are those who learn the Qur'an and teach it.\" [1]\nNarrated Abdullah: Allah's Messenger \ufdfa said, \"Do not wish to be like anybody except in two cases: The case of a man whom Allah has given wealth and he spends it in the right way, and that of a man whom Allah has given religious wisdom (i.e., Qur'an and Sunna) and he gives his verdicts according to it and teaches it.\" (to others i.e., religious knowledge of Qur'an and Sunna (Prophet's Traditions).\" [2]\nProphetic Supplication:We can learn this du'a which the Prophet Muhammad \ufdfa made asking Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 to make us noble, beautify us in faith, and be among those who are rightly guided.

Those that support the view of it being a name are Imam al-Ghazali and Ibn Arabi, among others.\nThe names of creating:As for discussions regarding Allah's unique inventiveness and creativity we've touched on this topic in the three names, Al-Khaliq (The Creator), Al-Bari (The Maker), and Al-Musawwir (The Fashioner).\n \u0623\u064e\u0641\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0645\u06e1 \u064a\u064e\u0646\u0638\u064f\u0631\u064f\u0648\u0653\u0627\u0652 \u0625\u0650\u0644\u064e\u0649 \u0671\u0644\u0633\u0651\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0627\u0653\u0621\u0650 \u0641\u064e\u0648\u06e1\u0642\u064e\u0647\u064f\u0645\u06e1 \u0643\u064e\u064a\u06e1\u0641\u064e \u0628\u064e\u0646\u064e\u064a\u06e1\u0646\u064e\u0670\u0647\u064e\u0627 \u0648\u064e\u0632\u064e\u064a\u0651\u064e\u0646\u0651\u064e\u0640\u0670\u0647\u064e\u0627 \u0648\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0627 \u0644\u064e\u0647\u064e\u0627 \u0645\u0650\u0646 \u0641\u064f\u0631\u064f\u0648\u062c\u0656\n \u0648\u064e\u0671\u0644\u06e1\u0623\u064e\u0631\u06e1\u0636\u064e \u0645\u064e\u062f\u064e\u062f\u06e1\u0646\u064e\u0670\u0647\u064e\u0627 \u0648\u064e\u0623\u064e\u0644\u06e1\u0642\u064e\u064a\u06e1\u0646\u064e\u0627 \u0641\u0650\u064a\u0647\u064e\u0627 \u0631\u064e\u0648\u064e\u0670\u0633\u0650\u064a\u064e \u0648\u064e\u0623\u064e\u0646\u06e2\u0628\u064e\u062a\u06e1\u0646\u064e\u0627 \u0641\u0650\u064a\u0647\u064e\u0627 \u0645\u0650\u0646 \u0643\u064f\u0644\u0651\u0650 \u0632\u064e\u0648\u06e1\u062c\u0650\u06ed \u0628\u064e\u0647\u0650\u064a\u062c\u0656\n \u062a\u064e\u0628\u06e1\u0635\u0650\u0631\u064e\u0629\u0657 \u0648\u064e\u0630\u0650\u0643\u06e1\u0631\u064e\u0649\u0670 \u0644\u0650\u0643\u064f\u0644\u0651\u0650 \u0639\u064e\u0628\u06e1\u062f\u0656 \u0645\u0651\u064f\u0646\u0650\u064a\u0628\u0656\n \u0648\u064e\u0646\u064e\u0632\u0651\u064e\u0644\u06e1\u0646\u064e\u0627 \u0645\u0650\u0646\u064e \u0671\u0644\u0633\u0651\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0627\u0653\u0621\u0650 \u0645\u064e\u0627\u0653\u0621\u0657 \u0645\u0651\u064f\u0628\u064e\u0670\u0631\u064e\u0643\u0657\u0627 \u0641\u064e\u0623\u064e\u0646\u06e2\u0628\u064e\u062a\u06e1\u0646\u064e\u0627 \u0628\u0650\u0647\u0650\u06e6 \u062c\u064e\u0646\u0651\u064e\u0640\u0670\u062a\u0656 \u0648\u064e\u062d\u064e\u0628\u0651\u064e \u0671\u0644\u06e1\u062d\u064e\u0635\u0650\u064a\u062f\u0650\n \u0648\u064e\u0671\u0644\u0646\u0651\u064e\u062e\u06e1\u0644\u064e \u0628\u064e\u0627\u0633\u0650\u0642\u064e\u0670\u062a\u0656 \u0644\u0651\u064e\u0647\u064e\u0627 \u0637\u064e\u0644\u06e1\u0639\u065e \u0646\u0651\u064e\u0636\u0650\u064a\u062f\u065e\n \u0631\u0651\u0650\u0632\u06e1\u0642\u0657\u0627 \u0644\u0651\u0650\u0644\u06e1\u0639\u0650\u0628\u064e\u0627\u062f\u0650\u06d6 \u0648\u064e\u0623\u064e\u062d\u06e1\u064a\u064e\u064a\u06e1\u0646\u064e\u0627 \u0628\u0650\u0647\u0650\u06e6 \u0628\u064e\u0644\u06e1\u062f\u064e\u0629\u0657 \u0645\u0651\u064e\u064a\u06e1\u062a\u0657\u0627\u06da \u0643\u064e\u0630\u064e\u0670\u0644\u0650\u0643\u064e \u0671\u0644\u06e1\u062e\u064f\u0631\u064f\u0648\u062c\u064f\n(6) Afalam yanzurooo ilas samaaa\u2019i fawqahum kaifa banainaahaa wa zaiyannaahaa wa maa lahaa min furooj (7) Wal arda madadnaahaa wa alqainaa feehaa rawaasiya wa ambatnaa feehaa min kulli zawjim baheej (8) Tabsiratanw wa zikraa likulli \u2018abdim muneeb (9) Wa nazzalnaa minas samaaa\u2019i maaa\u2019am mubaarakan fa ambatnaa bihee jannaatinw wa habbal haseed (10) Wannakhla baasiqaatil laha tal\u2019un nadeed (11) Rizqal lil\u2019ibaad, wa ahyainaa bihee baldatam maitaa; kazaalikal khurooj\nEnglish Translation:\"(6) Have they not looked at the heaven above them \u2013 how We structured it and adorned it and [how] it has no rifts?

We recognize it is Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 who has spoiled us with His blessings and all that is in the universe. In His uniqueness and perfection of attributes, everything is in harmonious balance. We may not see it this way if He's withheld something we desire, but we're surrounded by so many other blessings that they don't even register on our radar. We remain oblivious and unaware, which causes us to be unthankful. Whatever we focus on is what we will feel internally. But if we take the time to study and contemplate what it means for Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 to be Al-Badi, we can be increased in our shukr (thankfulness) towards Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 as many of His blessings will come to light.\nRealizing your uniqueness:You don't have to look further than to analyze the tip of your finger to be amazed. There are 7,753,000,000+ people on earth, and no two people share the same fingerprints. Not even identical twins. How can you not say, Subhanallah? Realize there will never be another you. No person walking this earth (past, present, or future) will look exactly like you and share the same experiences you've had, your personality, individual qualities, thoughts, or feelings. You are incomparable, a one-of-one but in a different sense.\nIt was narrated that Abu Hurairah said: \"The Messenger of Allah \ufdfa said: 'The strong believer is better and more beloved to Allah than the weak believer, although both are good. Strive for that which will benefit you, seek the help of Allah, and do not feel helpless. If anything befalls you, do not say, \"if only I had done such and such,\" rather say \"Qaddara Allahu wa ma sha'a fa'ala (Allah has decreed and whatever he wills, He does).\" For (saying) 'If' opens (the door) to the deeds of Satan.'\" [1]\nAsk yourself, how can you further yourself and become a rare distinguished individual in the sight of Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670? This can be increased in beneficial knowledge, temperance, in being a better husband or wife. Don't waste your effort on differentiating yourself in vain or superficial ways. This will be an endless chase and will not help to seek Allah's approval. Instead, you could become a unique individual in character. For example, who likes traffic? Only a rare person would find traffic amusing rather than frustrating. A time to sit, reflect and count the many blessings of Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670. The path many take is to get angry and impatient and feel justified in these emotions. All this is a deliberate decision to savor and enjoy all the experiences and possibilities of life. How many more unique perspectives like this are available to the mind to find and adopt? Each person's circumstance will be different and require deep reflection. But the outcome should bring about love for Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670.

To be permanent, everlasting, and constant. To survive forever, to be eternal. To be incessant, continuous, and endless.\nAmong the disputed names:As we've mentioned in the last name, different scholars have different criteria for what qualifies as a name of Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670. Of the 99 names, 81 are explicitly mentioned in the Qur'an. Therefore, there is not one agreed-upon list for the remaining 18 names. al-Baqi is one of those names which is not included by certain scholars. This list includes Ibn Uthaymeen, Ibn Hazm, and Ibn Hajar, among others. However, others, such as Ibn Arabi, Imam al-Bayhaqi, and al-Ghazali, have included this name in their lists.\nForever and Ever:We've briefly described this attribute of Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 in Al-Awwal (The First) and Al-Akhir (The Last), but there is a difference in the interpreted meaning each name conveys. Al-Awwal teaches us about Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 as being the beginning of all creation, Al-Akhir describes Him as being the last. However, with Al-Baqi, it describes Allah's nature to be everlasting or eternal. Being called the first and the last can seem bounded or constrained by time. Al-Baqi affirms to us that Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 transcends time. There is no before or after with respect to Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670. He just is and always will be.\nTime as it relates to Allah (\u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670):Time is a creation of Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670, and His perception of it is unchanging. As Imam Ghazali mentions, \"only changeable things participate in past or future because past or future are temporal expressions.\" So Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 can't be understood according to the same laws of physics He has bounded creation by. He transcends the nature of what He created and is not constrained by it. The mind is incapable of understanding what this truly means as itself is created by Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 and is limited by its very nature.\nThe prospect of Allah's non-existence seems completely irrational. Imam Ghazali further explains, \"He is the existent whose existence is necessary in itself.\" It is inconceivable to imagine how something could exist in and of itself.

And Allah is better and more enduring.'\" \u2014 (Qur'an 20:72-73)\nThe sorcerers became confident in Allah's existence and realized that the promises of Firawn were temporary and futile compared to the rewards of Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 who is more enduring.

And what is with Allah is better and more lasting; so will you not use reason?\" (Qur'an 28:60) This is similar to how Prophet Yusuf (as) made a du'a saying, \"My Lord, prison is more to my liking than that to which they invite me [...]\" (Qur'an 12:33). His faith in Allah's promise was so strong that he would rather go to prison being righteous than committing sin and being free. He recognized the rewards of Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 are far better and more everlasting than any temporary pleasure incited by shaitan.\nOn cursing time:Abu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (\ufdfa) as saying: Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, said: The son of Adam displeases Me by abusing Dahr (time), whereas I am Dahr (time)--I alter nate the night and the day. [1]\nIt is said in this hadith that the Prophet \ufdfa told us to not curse time. What is meant by time here? Time is reality, the unfolding of current events. Everything that happens is by the divine decree of Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670. By cursing what has happened you're complaining about what Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 ordained. As the hadith mentions, this is displeasing to Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670, and this reaction should be avoided. If something breaks, there's no point in verbally expressing discontent about what has already happened. The mind should automatically go to saying, alhamdulillah, and figure out the next best step. Don't suffer twice by lamenting what transpired and relieving the pain.\nAbu Sa'id al-Khudri reported that some people from among the Ansar begged from the Messenger of Allah \ufdfa and he gave them. They again begged him and he again gave them, till when what was in his possession was exhausted he said: Whatever good (riches, goods) I have, I will not withhold it from you. He who refrains from begging Allah safeguards him against want. and he who seeks sufficiency, Allah would keep him in a state of sufficiency, and he who shows endurance. Allah would grant him power to endure, and none is blessed with an endowment better and greater than endurance. [2]\nReflection:With regards to our connection with this name, it's limited as our life is finite. The thing we should exhibit permanence in is our imaan (faith). There is a blessing in meditating upon this further. We shouldn't procrastinate as the concept of forever is only for Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670. As Shaykh Tosun Bayrak writes, \"Yet there is a way to gain an eternal life during the short visit here. It is achieved by not tying one's heart to this world. It is by not working only for profit in this world, by not working for one's own immediate benefit. If one works for Allah's sake, for Allah's pleasure, for the benefit of Allah's creation now and in the future, when all is ended, and this body has returned to dust one's work will carry one to Eternity.\" As cliche as it sounds \u2014 and perhaps with the explanation of the name Al-Baqi it resonates more \u2014 we realize there is no better time for change than now. We should work towards bringing an end to destructive or unhealthy habits and promote/nurture the good ones.\nReferences:\n[1] Sahih Muslim 2246b\n[2] Sahih Muslim 1053a\n\n\n",

To whom belongs [all] sovereignty this Day? To Allah, the One, the Prevailing.\" \u2014 (Qur'an 40:16)\nThe 80-year-old version of you:The believer benefits from knowing that Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 is Al-Warith in many ways. There is a story of a very wealthy man who died. At his funeral, a colleague asked, \"I wonder how much he left?\" to which someone replied, \"I believe he left it all.\"\nThe lesson is that we need to be wiser in our pursuits and how we spend our time. One of the foundational teachings of Islam is that all things return to Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670. Nothing was ever ours to begin with. Imagine speaking with your 80-year-old self. What would the older you say to the you of today? Do you think he/she would be happy with how you're spending time? Perhaps you're too hard on yourself or sacrificed too much in the name of worldly pursuits. It's a useful way to think about decision-making; what would your eighty-year-old self think about the thing that's troubling the you of today?\nAs we mentioned previously, wanting financial security for your family's well-being is an honorable mission. When the only pursuit is money, that's a problem. Seeking enjoyment is fine.

And it is We who were the inheritors.\" \u2014 (Qur'an 28:58)\nThis ayah reminds us that all things will inevitably perish, and the cities will be destroyed. It's not hard to imagine the ambition that drove the people who lived in the city while it was thriving. They played the game to hoard, not realizing, in the end, it belongs to Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670.\nIslam encourages us not to focus on the material we leave behind but on the impact of our legacy. What good will your soul reap even long after you're gone? This is the concept behind Sadaqah jariyah (the continuing/perpetual charity). In this way, we can be the inheritors of whatever/whoever our unique touch reaches. Sahl bin Mu'adh bin Anas narrated from his father that: The Prophet said: \"Whoever teaches some knowledge will have the reward of the one who acts upon it, without that detracting from his reward in the slightest.\" [1] Being a teacher or educator allows us to reap the same reward as the person who learns from it. Who can be a teacher? Just about everybody. This does not mean teaching as a profession. You can share your experience and invite others in to learn from your wisdom or mistakes. Sometimes we try to conceal our past from kids to \"protect them,\" not realizing we're just protecting the image of ourselves. They can benefit from the knowledge of the good and the bad we've realized. It's an opportunity for redemption as we also receive the reward if it helps them do good and avoid evil.\nOther examples of sadaqah jariyah, Narrated Sa'd ibn Ubadah: Sa'd asked: Messenger of Allah, Umm Sa'd has died; what form of sadaqah is best? He replied: Water (is best). He dug a well and said: It is for Umm Sa'd. [2]\n\"It was narrated from Abu Hurairah that the Messenger of Allah \ufdfa said: 'When a man dies all his good deeds come to an end except three: Ongoing charity (Sadaqah Jariyah), beneficial knowledge and a righteous son who prays for him.'\" [3] Seek ways in which your good deeds will multiply without your involvement. Having kids and raising them to be righteous will be one of the greatest future rewards to benefit you. All the love and energy you spend as a parent is stored inside your child. That kind of effort is not wasted. Like a bank, it's stored and will be inherited by the next generation and then the next. Your soul continues to live through them, and your account will reap whatever good they sow. Consider writing down your own principles on what it means to live a good life and pass it down. You don't need to be a best-selling author to get permission to say a few words on a page.\nIf we reframe our actions by thinking of the future impact we can create, it can inspire us to do great things. It doesn't have to be grandiose. It can be as simple as planting a tree.

Of the 99 names, 81 are explicitly mentioned in the Qur'an. Therefore, there is not one agreed-upon list for the remaining 18 names. Ar-Rasheed is one of those names which is not included by certain scholars. This list includes Ibn al-Wazir, Ibn Hazm, and Ibn al-Uthaymeen. However, others, such as Ibn Arabi, Imam al-Bayhaqi, and Imam al-Ghazali, have included this name in their lists.\nThe one who is guided:\nThe name of Allah Ar-Rasheed, The Rightly Guided, is similar to a name we've already discussed Al-Hadi, meaning The Guide. However, being called rightly guided negates all negative connotations. He is infallible in His direction, and to be misguided is inconceivable. Similar in meaning to the name Al-Hakeem, (The Wise). Imam al-Ghazali writes of Ar-Rasheed as \"acting without any indication of an advisor or the directions of a director or the guidance of a guide.\" His very essence is to be rightly guided.\nThe name Rashid is often said to describe an educated person who's been \"rightly guided\" or possesses \"true faith.\" A derivative, Murshid, is an Arabic word derived from the same root r-sh-d to describe a teacher. The job of a teacher is to be a guide for a particular subject or topic. In the next ayah, we'll see the use of the word ghayy which is the opposite of rushd meaning guidance to the wrong path.\n \u0644\u064e\u0622  \u0625\u0650\u0643\u06e1\u0631\u064e\u0627\u0647\u064e  \u0641\u0650\u064a  \u0671\u0644\u062f\u0650\u0651\u064a\u0646\u0650\u06d6  \u0642\u064e\u062f  \u062a\u064e\u0651\u0628\u064e\u064a\u064e\u0651\u0646\u064e  \u0671\u0644\u0631\u064f\u0651\u0634\u06e1\u062f\u064f  \u0645\u0650\u0646\u064e  \u0671\u0644\u06e1\u063a\u064e\u064a\u0650\u0651\u06da  \u0641\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0646  \u064a\u064e\u0643\u06e1\u0641\u064f\u0631\u06e1  \u0628\u0650\u0671\u0644\u0637\u064e\u0651\u0640\u0670\u063a\u064f\u0648\u062a\u0650  \u0648\u064e\u064a\u064f\u0624\u06e1\u0645\u0650\u0646\u06e2  \u0628\u0650\u0671\u0644\u0644\u064e\u0651\u0647\u0650  \u0641\u064e\u0642\u064e\u062f\u0650  \u0671\u0633\u06e1\u062a\u064e\u0645\u06e1\u0633\u064e\u0643\u064e  \u0628\u0650\u0671\u0644\u06e1\u0639\u064f\u0631\u06e1\u0648\u064e\u0629\u0650  \u0671\u0644\u06e1\u0648\u064f\u062b\u06e1\u0642\u064e\u0649\u0670  \u0644\u064e\u0627  \u0671\u0646\u0641\u0650\u0635\u064e\u0627\u0645\u064e  \u0644\u064e\u0647\u064e\u0627\u06d7  \u0648\u064e\u0671\u0644\u0644\u064e\u0651\u0647\u064f  \u0633\u064e\u0645\u0650\u064a\u0639\u064c  \u0639\u064e\u0644\u0650\u064a\u0645\u064c\nLaaa ikraaha fid deeni qat tabiyanar rushdu minal ghayy; famai yakfur bit Taaghooti wa yu'mim billaahi faqadis tamsaka bil'urwatil wusqaa lan fisaama lahaa; wallaahu Samee'un 'Aleem\nMUHSIN KHAN TRANSLATION:\"There is no compulsion in religion.

The guidance that He has provided is divine guidance. He is the unerring director and the infallible teacher. Therefore His direction through the Qur'an and His Messengers (may peace be upon them) is the truth that we seek. We should ask to be rightly guided in all matters. We should approach each problem we face with the looming thought, what response would please Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670?

We should have no regret knowing the actions taken were for the best.\nIn the personal striving to have the best character, we should seek to be rightly guided in our speech, knowledge, justice, and emotions. There is a balance to emotions that require mastery. When we suffer a loss, we are allowed to grieve, but we shouldn't become so hurt that we are unhappy with Allah's qadr. It's also possible to be rightly guided in anger. For example, anger for the sake of Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 is justified.

            "mentions-from-quran-hadith": "\n\nArabic Root:From the root sad-ba-ra (\u0635 \u0628 \u0631), which has the following classical Arabic connotations: to be patient, to be enduring, to endure trial or affliction with good manner, to be contented in trial or affliction without show of complaint, to make no distinction between comfort and affliction, to bear calmly, to persevere cheerfully, to be steadfast, constant, to restrain, confine, withhold from something.\nAmong the disputed names:As we've mentioned in previous names, different scholars have different criteria for what qualifies as a name of Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670. Of the 99 names, 81 are explicitly mentioned in the Qur'an. Therefore, there is not one agreed-upon list for the remaining 18 names. As-Sabur is one of those names which is not included by certain scholars. This list includes Ibn al-Wazir, Ibn Hazm, and Ibn al-Uthaymeen. However, others, such as Ibn Arabi, Imam al-Bayhaqi, and Imam al-Ghazali, have included this name in their lists.\nDoes Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 have more than ninety-nine names?Alhamdulillah, we've reached the \"last name\" of Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670. We put this in quotes because Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 has many, many names, and there is no one definitive list. As we've mentioned about the disputed names, different scholars recognize different attributes of Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 which they derive from the Qur'an and Sunnah. For example, Ibn Uthaymeen includes names such as Al-Jameel (The Beautiful One), Al-Jawad (The Munificent/Generous), Ash-Shafee (The One who Cures), At-Tayyib (The Pure One), Ar-Rabb (The Lord), Ar-Rafeeq (The Gentle), Al-Illah (The one who is to be worshipped). These names may already be familiar to you, and as attributes of Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 they are completely acceptable.\nAllah has ninety-nine Names, i.e., one hundred minus one, and whoever believes in their meanings and acts accordingly will enter Paradise.  [1] The analogy which is often quoted to explain this hadith is if you were to say I have ninety-nine dollars, does that mean that's all you have? No, that's all you may have in your wallet, but it's not all you have.\nIbn Mas'ud reported: The Messenger of Allah \ufdfa said, \"If any Muslim is afflicted with distress and makes this supplication, then his supplication will be answered: O Allah, I am Your servant, the son of Your servant, the son of Your maidservant. My forelock is in Your hand, Your command concerning me prevails, and Your decision concerning me is fair. I call upon You by every one of the beautiful names with which You have described Yourself, or which You have revealed in Your Book, or You have taught to any of Your creatures, or which You have chosen to keep in the knowledge of the Unseen with You, to make the Quran the delight of my soul, the light of my heart, and to remove my sadness and dispel my anxiety.\" The Prophet said, \"If he says this, Allah will remove his affliction and replace it with joy and happiness.\" [2]\nWe emphasize one part of the hadith, \"...or which You have chosen to keep in the knowledge of the Unseen with You,\" which implies there are names and qualities of Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 which are not known to man. If Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 is Al-Kabeer (The Great One), we must realize the extent of His greatness can't be fully understood. So in studying these attributes, we only get a glimpse of His essence.\nExploring the name As-Sabur:The name of Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 As-Sabur, the patient. As we come to know from these attributes, Allah's blessings are immense. We are forever indebted to Him, and we could never reciprocate or do enough to equalize the blessings He's given us. The gift of life, our health, faith, and its sustenance in every moment is because of His will. In return, Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 commands from us very little, and even in that, we sometimes fall short. For example, even when we offer our Salah, it can be deficient. Our bodies go through the motion, our tongues say the words, but our minds remain preoccupied with worldly distractions. We're thinking of things we can't wait to do after our prayer is over instead of being present in our salah.\nAt other times we transgress the boundaries of acceptable behavior. We defy His command with things He has forbidden. In every situation, He has complete right to exercise His power and give an equal punishment, but He abstains, for He is Al-Haleem (The Forbearing / The Clement One). He withholds His right to convict and keeps the doors of repentance and forgiveness open. That is how merciful Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 is. Even when there is reason to punish, He does not punish.\nImam al-Ghazali writes about this very nature of Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 to delay. This restraint is not like a lazy person who procrastinates or a rash person who hastens to retaliate. Rather, As-Sabur is the one who disposes of \"each thing in its proper time, in the way in which it needs to be and according to what it requires.\" Everything is perfectly handled by Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 according to His definite plan.\nNarrated Abu Musa: The Prophet \ufdfa said: None is more patient than Allah against the harmful saying. He hears from the people they ascribe children to Him, yet He gives them health and (supplies them with) provision.\" [3]\nNote, however, it does not refer to Him by the title As-Sabur but instead describes His essence or quality as being patient. Similarly, in the Qur'an, we'll see verses describing His nature of showing respite.\n \u0648\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0648\u06e1 \u064a\u064f\u0624\u064e\u0627\u062e\u0650\u0630\u064f \u0671\u0644\u0644\u0651\u064e\u0647\u064f \u0671\u0644\u0646\u0651\u064e\u0627\u0633\u064e \u0628\u0650\u0645\u064e\u0627 \u0643\u064e\u0633\u064e\u0628\u064f\u0648\u0627\u0652 \u0645\u064e\u0627 \u062a\u064e\u0631\u064e\u0643\u064e \u0639\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 \u0638\u064e\u0647\u06e1\u0631\u0650\u0647\u064e\u0627 \u0645\u0650\u0646 \u062f\u064e\u0627\u0653\u0628\u0651\u064e\u0629\u0656 \u0648\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0670\u0643\u0650\u0646 \u064a\u064f\u0624\u064e\u062e\u0651\u0650\u0631\u064f\u0647\u064f\u0645\u06e1 \u0625\u0650\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670\u0653 \u0623\u064e\u062c\u064e\u0644\u0656 \u0645\u0651\u064f\u0633\u064e\u0645\u0651\u0657\u0649\u06d6 \u0641\u064e\u0625\u0650\u0630\u064e\u0627 \u062c\u064e\u0627\u0653\u0621\u064e \u0623\u064e\u062c\u064e\u0644\u064f\u0647\u064f\u0645\u06e1 \u0641\u064e\u0625\u0650\u0646\u0651\u064e \u0671\u0644\u0644\u0651\u064e\u0647\u064e \u0643\u064e\u0627\u0646\u064e \u0628\u0650\u0639\u0650\u0628\u064e\u0627\u062f\u0650\u0647\u0650\u06e6 \u0628\u064e\u0635\u0650\u064a\u0631\u064e\u06e2\u0627\nWa law yu'aakhizul laahun naasa bima kasaboo maa taraka 'alaa zahrihaa min daaabbatinw wa laakiny yu'akhkhiruhum ilaaa ajalim musamman fa izaa jaaa'a ajaluhum fa innal laaha kaana bi'ibaadihee Baseeraa (section 5)\nEnglish Translation:\"And if Allah were to impose blame on the people for what they have earned, He would not leave upon the earth any creature. But He defers them for a specified term. And when their time comes, then indeed Allah has ever been, of His servants, Seeing.\" \u2014 (Qur'an 35:45)\n\n\nReflection: The one who sees Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 as As-Sabur can only be increased in their love for Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670. We see Him in the best light as a Lord who shows ultimate grace and patience for all of humanity. We see His treatment and gentleness as being caring, giving us a chance for redemption. A chance to turn back to Him if we've erred in any way. We should rejoice in knowing our creator is forbearing and does not hasten to punish even though it would be most just and deserving if He should.\nShaykh Tosun Bayrak writes, \"patience is in Allah's Divine disposition; therefore, patient people reflect this honored disposition.\" But the question we ask is patience always a virtue? In a previous reflection, we discuss the character trait of acting fast with a sense of urgency. To understand the finiteness of our lives and to not delay any activity further than it needs to be. How can we reconcile that with the quality of being patient?\nIt requires discernment to know when to apply what. Should you wait to do good deeds? If something can be done now, would it be better to wait until tomorrow? Let's say you set a worthy goal for yourself. Should you stop pursuing it if the deadline you set has passed? Or imagine a scenario of your child learning to walk. Would you ask Allah \u0633\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0670\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f\u06e5 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0670\u0644\u064e\u0649\u0670 only once to make it easy for them? If they didn't learn right away, would you just quit and say, \"that's it, I guess she's not a walker.\"\nA person should exercise this quality to abstain from things he/she desires but knows it does not serve them. This is obvious for things that are clearly forbidden in Islam but also pose a danger to your well-being (e.g., alcohol). But there exists a category that, on the surface, can seem enticing and offer some initial benefit. These can be very dangerous, it creeps in quietly, corrupting goodness without our knowledge. An example is the use of credit cards. There are real benefits to using cards, cash-back, points, security & safety, and building your credit score. If an unauthorized purchase is made, you can call and get it reversed, whereas, with a debit card, you're responsible.\nYet, somehow, all the stats around credit cards are scary. In 2021 55% of Americans had a balance on their cards month-to-month, 15% have been in debt for 15 years, and 6% or 14 million people have over $10,000 worth of credit card debt. This will likely only get worse with time. We live in a society where credit cards are a near necessity for most individuals. It would be best to be patient and restrained from using these \"tools\" when you don't need to. This can be hard because once you start transacting with a credit card, it opens the door for many troubles to walk right in. You can easily overspend what you earn on things you didn't need but want. It's a constant battle. But Anas b. Malik reported: The Paradise is surrounded by hardships, and the Hell-Fire is surrounded by temptations. [4]\nIn the Qur'an and hadith, many passages further encourage us to be patient (i.e., showing sabr). This includes patience in one's faith, patience/restraint in dealing with those who may try to harm you, and abstaining from foul language. It also extends to patience when dealing with some tragedy that has befallen you. The Prophet \ufdfa said, \"What wealth I have, I will not hoard from you. Whoever has forbearance, Allah will help him. Whoever tries to be independent, Allah will enrich him.
