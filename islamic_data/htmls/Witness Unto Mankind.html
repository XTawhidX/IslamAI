<h3>1. Praise and Salutations - Our Message</h3> 
<h4>Praise and Salutations</h4> 
<p>All praise be to God who alone is the Creator, Master and Sovereign 
of the universe. It is He who rules over it with perfect wisdom, 
absolute power and infinite mercy. He who has created man, endowed him 
with knowledge and reason, made him His vicegerent on earth, and has 
sent His Books and Messengers to guide him. </p> 
<p>May God bless all those righteous and noble servants of His who were 
appointed to teach man how to live as true human beings and who made man
 aware of the real purpose of his life, and showed him the right way to 
live in this world. Whatever measure of true guidance, morality, piety, 
and selflessness that the world possesses today, it owes to the 
teachings of these servants of God, peace be upon them. This is a debt 
that can never be sufficiently repaid. </p> 
<h4>Our Message</h4> 
<p>Brothers and friends, we usually divide our meetings into two parts. 
In one part, we review, among ourselves, our activities and discuss 
plans for their advancement. The other part we devote to conveying our 
message to the people of the area where we hold
<pg>1/31</pg><pd></pd><hd>Witness Unto Mankind</hd>
 our meeting. We have, thus, asked you to join us in this meeting so that we may explain our message to you. </p> 
<p>On the one hand our message is addressed to Muslims, and on the other
 hand to all those human beings who are outside the fold of Islam. It is
 unfortunate, however, that I do not see here today people belonging to 
the second category. Our past mistakes and present errors are 
responsible for alienating a great many people from us. Therefore, we 
hardly ever find the opportunity either to draw them near to us or draw 
near to them, so that we may communicate to them the message sent by 
God, in whom we all believe, through His Messengers for the guidance of 
us all. Since we do not have any non-Muslims present amongst us, I shall
 only concentrate upon that part of our message which is meant for 
Muslims. </p> 
<h3>2. The Purpose and Duty of the Muslim Ummah </h3> 
<h4>Responsibilities and Duties</h4> 
<p>To the Muslims we have only one very simple thing to say: Understand 
and fulfil the responsibilities and duties that fall upon you by virtue 
of your being Muslims. You cannot get away with merely affirming that 
you are Muslims and that you have accepted God as your only God and 
Islam as your religion. Rather, as soon as you acknowledge Allah as your
 only Lord and His guidance as your way of life, you take upon 
yourselves certain obligations and duties. These obligations you must 
always remain conscious of, these duties you must always endeavour to 
discharge. If you evade them, you shall not escape the evil consequences
 of your conduct in this world or in the Hereafter. </p> 
<p>What are these duties? They are not merely confined to the 
affirmation of faith in Allah, His Angels, His Books, His Messengers, 
and the Day of Judgement. Nor are they confined to performing the 
Prayers, observing the Fasts, going on the Pilgrimage, and paying the 
Alms. Nor are these duties exhausted by observing the injunctions of 
Islam relating to marriage, divorce and inheritance. Over and above all 
these duties, there is one which is the most important: that your lives 
bear witness to the Truth that you have been given by God before all 
mankind, the Truth which you believe to be true. </p> 
<h4>The Only Purpose of Existence</h4> 
<p>The Qur'an clearly states that witnessing to the Truth in a manner 
that would leave mankind with no justifiable ground to deny it is the 
only purpose behind constituting
<pg>2/31</pg><pd></pd><hd>Witness Unto Mankind</hd>
 you as a distinct Ummah (community), named Muslims. </p> 
<p>And thus We have made you a community of the middle way, so that you 
may be witnesses [to the Truth] before all mankind, and the Messenger 
may be witness [to it] before you (al-Baqarah 2: 143). </p> 
<p>This mission is the sole objective for which your Ummah has been 
brought into being, it is the raison d'etre of its existence as a 
society of human beings. Unless you fulfil it you are squandering your 
life. For this is no ordinary duty; it is a duty enjoined on you by God.
 It is a Divine command and a Divine call: </p> 
<p>O believers, be ever steadfast in standing up, for the sake of God, bearing witness to justice (al-Ma'idah 5: 8) . </p> 
<p>It is not a mere trifle but an emphatic and grave mandate, for Allah also says: </p> 
<p>And who is a greater wrong-doer than he who suppresses a witness entrusted to him by God (al-Baqarah 2: 140). </p> 
<p>You have been warned of the consequences of evading this duty. Look 
at the history of the people of Israel. They too were appointed to stand
 in the witness-box; but sometimes they suppressed the Truth, and 
sometimes they witnessed against it. By their conduct, they, in fact, 
became witnesses to falsehood rather than witnesses to the Truth. The 
consequence was that God forsook them and a curse fell upon them. </p> 
<p>And so, humiliation and powerlessness afflicted them, and they earned God's anger (al-Baqarah 2: 61). </p> 
<h4>Witness to the Truth</h4> 
<p>What does this duty of witness imply? Consider it carefully: You have
 been given Divine guidance, you have been shown the Truth. You must, 
therefore, establish by your testimony and witness its authenticity and 
truthfulness before all mankind. This is a testimony that will make the 
authenticity and truthfulness of Divine guidance self-evident, for all 
to see, and a witness that will make it clear and indisputable for all 
people. </p> 
<p>For this very purpose all the Messengers were sent to the world; this
 was their primary duty. After them, their followers were entrusted with
 the same duty. And now the Muslim Ummah, as the successor to the Last 
Prophet, blessings and peace be on him, is
<pg>3/31</pg><pd></pd><hd>Witness Unto Mankind</hd>
 charged with this very mission, just as he was charged with it during his lifetime. </p> 
<h4>Nature and Importance</h4> 
<p>What is the importance of this witness? You will know its importance 
only when you understand that man has been made accountable for his 
conduct and will be rewarded and punished in the Hereafter under the 
Divine Law which rests entirely on this witness. God is All- wise, 
All-merciful, and All just. His mercy, justice and wisdom are not such 
that He should punish people for living against His will while they had 
no knowledge of it, that He should take people to task for deviating 
from the right path of which they were ignorant, that He should hold 
people accountable for things of which they were unaware. [1] It was as a
 provision against this that the first man He created was a Messenger, 
and that after him many more were sent from time to time. [2] They were 
all to be witnesses to mankind, to make it understand and remember the 
will of God. They were all to teach human beings the proper way of 
conducting their lives, the code of behaviour that they should adopt to 
win God's favour, the acts that they should perform, the acts that they 
should avoid, and the things for which they will be brought to account. 
[3] </p> 
<p>This witness was given by Allah's Messengers so that the people may 
not be in a position to say to God: How can we be punished for things of
 which we were not warned? The Qur'an says: </p> 
<p>[We sent] all Messengers as heralds of glad tidings and as warners, 
so that men may not have any argument against God, after [the coming of]
 these Messengers; God is indeed All-mighty, All-wise (al- Nisa' 4: 
165). </p> 
<p>In this manner God made His Messengers bear the crucial 
responsibility for guiding man on His behalf. They were thus charged 
with a very delicate and grave responsibility: if they bore witness to 
the Truth properly, the people would be accountable for their own 
actions, but if they failed in their duty, they themselves would be 
called to account for their people going astray. In other words, unless 
the Messengers made people responsible for their conduct by giving them 
conclusive and indisputable testimony to the Truth, the people would 
hold the Messengers responsible for their own misdeeds, saying: 'The 
knowledge that God gave you, that you did not communicate to us; the way
 of life that He showed you, that you did not show US.' [4] That is why 
all the Messengers always remained acutely conscious of the burden of 
this responsibility, and that is why
<pg>4/31</pg><pd></pd><hd>Witness Unto Mankind</hd>
 they endeavoured so hard to bear witness before the people to the Truth entrusted to them. [5] </p> 
<h4>Responsibility of the Ummah</h4> 
<p>All those who were led by the Messengers to the knowledge of the 
Truth and Divine guidance were formed into a community, an Ummah. Every 
Ummah was charged with the same mission as the Messengers of witnessing 
to the Truth. As successors to the Messengers, every Ummah has the same 
crucial role and responsibility as they had. Thus, if an Ummah properly 
fulfils its duty of witnessing to the Truth and yet the people do not 
pay heed, it will be rewarded and the people will be brought to account.
 However, if the Ummah neglects its duty, or if it gives false witness, 
it will deserve to be punished more severely than the people. The Ummah 
shall be accountable not only for its own misdeeds, but also for the 
misdeeds of those who went astray or turned to error and wickedness 
because the testimony given to them by the Ummah was misleading or 
false. </p> 
<p>This, brothers, is the nature and logic of that grave and crucial 
duty which lies upon me, you and all those who consider themselves part 
of the Muslim Ummah, or those who have become sufficiently aware of 
God's Book and the guidance brought by His Messengers. </p> 
<h4>Notes by Khurram Murad</h4> 
<h4>1. Law of God for Judgement:</h4> 
<p>The Qur'an has explained in considerable detail the law under which 
man's accountability on the Day of Judgement depends upon the witness to
 the Truth rendered by its bearers before him. It is important to 
understand what the Qur'an says in this regard. </p> 
<p>Firstly, why has man been placed on earth? So that he may use his 
full and enormous potential to conduct himself in that right manner 
which will fulfil the meaning in his life. </p> 
<p>And He it is who has created the heavens and the earth in six days, 
and His throne was upon the waters, so that He might test you which of 
you is best in conduct (Hud 11: 7). </p> 
<p>He who has created death and life, so that He might test you, which of you is best in conduct (al-Mulk 67: 2). </p> 
<p>We have made all that is on earth an adornment for it, and so that we might test which
<pg>5/31</pg><pd></pd><hd>Witness Unto Mankind</hd>
 of them is best in conduct (al-Kahf 18: 7). </p> 
<p>Secondly, what is the meaning and purpose of man's life? That he 
lives as his Creator desires him to live: in surrender and worship to 
Him alone. Not because God in any way needs his worship, but because man
 needs to worship only his Creator and none else so that his own nature 
is not perverted and corrupted, and so that he does not live in 
opposition to its intrinsic character. Also, only by so living, will his
 earthly life be set on the right path and will prosper, bringing him 
peace and happiness (all of which the Qur'an calls falah). </p> 
<p>And I have not created Jinn and mankind except to serve and worship 
Me. I desire of them no provision, neither do I desire that they should 
feed Me (al-Dhariyat 51: 5S7). </p> 
<p>Thirdly, and consequently, man's earthly life must be judged. He must
 give an account of his conduct, and he must face the consequences of 
how he lives his life. Obviously, to be judged fairly, this judgement 
must be made only after his earthly life has come to an end, and only by
 the One who gave this life, who knows everything, and who is 
All-Powerful and All-Just. Only then can he be judged fairly, and duly 
rewarded and punished, for everything from the most hidden innermost 
thoughts to the consequences of his conduct that extend far and wide, 
and beyond life for generations to come. The judge, in other words, must
 be the King and Master of the Day of Judgement. </p> 
<p>What, did you think that We created you in mere idle play, and that 
you would not be returned to Us? But, high exalted is God, the King, the
 True! There is no god but He, the Lord of the Noble Throne (alMu'minun 
23: 115-16). </p> 
<p>And We have not created the heavens and the earth and all that is 
between them in mere idle play; We have not created them but with truth 
[meaning and purpose], but most of them understand it not (al-Dukhan 44:
 38-9). </p> 
<p>Or, do those who commit evil deeds think that We shall place them on 
an equal footing with those who believe and do righteous deeds, both in 
their life and their death? How bad is their judgement! God has created 
the heavens and the earth with truth [meaning and purpose], so that 
every human being shall be recompensed for what he has earned, and they 
shall not be wronged (al-Jathiyah 45: 212). Every human being shall 
taste death; and you shall surely be paid in full your wages on the Day 
of Resurrection; whosoever [then] is saved from the Fire and admitted to
 Paradise, he indeed wins the triumph; worldly life is nothing but 
enjoyment of delusion (Al 'Imran 3: 185).
<pg>6/31</pg><pd></pd><hd>Witness Unto Mankind</hd>
 </p> 
<p>And We shall set up just balance-scales on Resurrectlon Day, and no 
human being shall be wronged anything; even if it be the weight of a 
mustard-seed, We shall bring it forth, and sufficient are We as 
reckoners (al-Anbiya' 21: 47). </p> 
<p>He knows the [most] stealthy glance, and what the hearts conceal (Ghafir 40: 19). </p> 
<p>Fourthly, therefore, man's ultimate destiny lies in the life to come,
 in the Akhirah. Equally important is the fact that the account of the 
Akhirah as given in the Qur'an clearly demonstrates, and repeatedly 
emphasizes, that one will be judged there by due process of justice, 
fairly and equitably, mercifully and kindly. Also, no one will be 
wronged or dealt with unjustly even by an atom's weight. </p> 
<p>And vie with one another, hastening to forgiveness from your Lord, 
and to Paradise as vast as the heavens and the earth, which has been 
prepared for the God-conscious (Al 'Imran 3: 133). </p> 
<p>O my people, surely this worldly life is but a brief enjoyment; 
surely the world to come is the home abiding. [There] whosoever does an 
evil deed shall be recompensed only with the like of it, but whosoever 
does righteous deeds be it man or woman, and is a believer those shall 
enter Paradise, therein provided [with blessings] beyond all reckoning 
(Ghafir 40: 39-40). </p> 
<p>Surely God shall not wrong so much as an atoms weight (al-Nisa' 4: 40). </p> 
<p>Fifthly, in all fairness, therefore, man must be made aware of how he
 should live his earthly life. In other words, he should know of his 
Creator and Lord, of what He desires of him, of how He wants him to 
worship Him and surrender to Him. Unless man knows all this, he cannot 
be held fully responsible and accountable if he pursues a wrong way of 
life. Such knowledge has been given to him in his own nature, in the 
universe around him, and in the revelations sent through God's 
Messengers. </p> 
<p>And when your Lord brought forth from the Children of Adam, from 
their loins, their descendants, and made them bear witness about 
themselves: Am I not your Lord? They said: Yes, we bear witness lest you
 say on the Day of Resurrection: We were unaware of this. Or lest you 
say: Our fathers ascribed partners [to God] aforetime, and we were but 
their descendants after them. What, wilt Thou then destroy us for the 
deeds of the vain-doers? (al-A'raf 7: 172-3) . </p>
<pg>7/31</pg><pd></pd><hm>Witness Unto Mankind</hm>
 
<p>How many a sign there is in the heavens and on earth which they pass 
by [unthinkingly], and on which they turn their backs! And most of them 
do not believe in God, but they ascribe partners [to Him] (Yusuf 12: 
105-6). </p> 
<p>[And God will say:] O community of jinn and men, did not </p> 
<p>Messengers come unto you from among you, who conveyed unto you My 
revelations and warned you of the meeting of this your day? . . . That 
is because your Lord would not destroy communities unjustly, while their
 people are ignorant (al-An'am 6: 130-1). </p> 
<p>Sixthly, for a number of reasons, all of which it is not possible to 
discuss here, only God, and no one else, can provide man with the 
knowledge of the right guidance. Firstly and primarily, because only He 
can tell how man should relate to Him. Secondly, because only the 
Creator can tell him how he should relate to himself, to other human 
beings, and to all other things in the universe. And, finally, because 
only God can give man a guidance which will be applicable universally, 
and for all times. </p> 
<p>Say: Is there any of those you associate [with God] who guides to the
 Truth? Say: Only God guides to the Truth. Thus, then, He who guides to 
the Truth deserves more to be followed or He who cannot guide unless he 
be guided? What ails you? How judge you? And most of them follow nothing
 but conjecture, and conjecture can never take the place of truth (Yunus
 10: 35-6). </p> 
<p>Say: Shall we call, apart from God, on that which neither benefits us
 nor harms us, and shall we be turned back on our heels after God has 
guided us aright? Like one lured to bewilderment on the earth by Satans,
 and he has friends who call him to guidance: Come to us! Say: God's 
guidance is the only [true] guidance; and so we have been commanded to 
surrender to the Lord of all the worlds (al-An'am 6: 71). </p> 
<p>This, then, is the Divine law for the judgement of man. Central to 
this law is that the Truth be witnessed before mankind fully, 
faithfully, and by all possible means. For without guidance from God, 
man's earthly life, both individual and collective, will result in 
misery and suffering. But, more importantly, without that guidance man 
will never be in a position to make his ultimate destiny glorious. </p> 
<h4>2. God's promise to guide:</h4> 
<p>Adam, according to the Qur'an, is neither a mythical figure nor merely a symbol of the
<pg>8/31</pg><pd></pd><hd>Witness Unto Mankind</hd>
 human race. He is mentioned, as a Messenger, along with Noah and Abraham. </p> 
<p>God chose Adam, and Noah, and the House of Abraham and the House of 
Imran above all mankind, offspring of one another (Al 'Imran 3: 33). </p> 
<p>He was given knowledge and guidance (2: 31-5); when he erred and his 
weaknesses became known to him, God turned towards him in mercy, 
exhalted him, guided him and promised him and his progeny continuing 
guidance (20: 115-27, 2: 3S9). </p> 
<p>Adam disobeyed his Lord, and so he erred. Thereafter his Lord chose 
him, and so He turned towards him, and He guided him. He said: Get you 
down, both of you, from here, each of you an enemy to each. Nonetheless,
 there shall most certainly come unto you guidance from Me; and he who 
follows My guidance shall not go astray, neither shall he be 
unprosperous. But whosoever turns away from My remembrance, his shall be
 a life of narrow scope; and on the Resurrection Day, We shall raise him
 blind. He shall say: O my Lord, why has Thou raised me blind, whereas I
 was given sight? God shall say: Thus it is. Our revelations came unto 
you and you did forget them; and so today you are forgotten (Ta Ha 20: 
121-6). </p> 
<h4>3. Messengers and their mission:</h4> 
<p>It was in fulfilment of this promise to mankind that, firstly, God 
sent His Messengers with His guidance, with the Truth, to every people 
some of them the Qur'an has named, some it has not. </p> 
<p>We have sent you [O Prophet] with the Truth, as a bearer of glad 
tidings and a warner; not a community there is, but there has passed 
away in it a warner (al-Fatir 35: 24). </p> 
<p>We have revealed to you [O Prophet] as We revealed to Noah and the 
Prophets after him, as We revealed to Abraham and Ishmael and Isaac and 
Jacob and their descendants, including Jesus and Job and Jonah and Aaron
 and Solomon, and as We gave to David Psalms; and Messengers We have 
mentioned to you before, and Messengers We have not mentioned to you; 
and as God spoke His word unto Moses. Messengers [We sent] as heralds of
 glad tidings and as warners, so that mankind might have no excuse 
before God after [the coming of] the Messengers; and God is All-mighty, 
All- wise (al-Nisa' 4: 163-5). </p> 
<p>Secondly, He charged all of them with this mission and duty: to 
communicate the Truth, to invite people to worship the One God alone and
 surrender to Him as their only Lord
<pg>9/31</pg><pd></pd><hd>Witness Unto Mankind</hd>
 by word and example. In other words, to witness to the Truth before men
 and women to whom they were sent, so that they could have no plea to 
make before God, so that they could be questioned as to how they lived 
their lives, so that those who lived by the Truth could be rewarded, and
 those who did not could be punished. </p> 
<p>And We never sent, before you, any Messenger except that We revealed 
to him: There is no god but I; so serve and worship only Me (al-Anbiya' 
21: 25). </p> 
<p>And this was Our argument, which We gave to Abraham as against his 
people. We raise up in degrees whom We will; surely your Lord is 
All-wise, All-knowing. And We gave Isaac and Jacob, and both of them We 
guided and Noah We guided beforeand [We guided] of his descendants: 
David, and Solomon, and Job, and Joseph, and Moses, and Aaron and thes 
do We reward the doers of good Zachariah and John, and Jesus, and 
Elijah, each was of the righteous; and Ishmael, and Elisha, and Jonah, 
and Lut. And every one of them did We favour above other people. And 
[likewise We guided] some of their forefathers and their descendants and
 their brethren. And We elected them, and guided them onto the straight 
path. That is God's guidance; He guides by it whomsoever He wills of His
 servants. And had they ascribed partners [to God], in vain would have 
been all that they ever did. Those are they to whom We gave the Book, 
and the Judgement, and the Prophethood. So if these deny this [Our 
guidance], We have entrusted it to people who do not disbelieve in it. 
Those [Messengers] are they whom God has guided; follow, then, their 
guidance. Say: I ask of you no reward for it; it is but a reminder unto 
all mankind (al-An'am 6: 83-90). </p> 
<p>Indeed We sent forth Our Messengers with clear revelations and We 
sent down with them the Book and the Balance, so that mankind may 
establish justice (al-Hadld 57: 25). </p> 
<p>The Prophet Muhammad was the last of them. He did not bring any new 
Truth, message or guidance; he came with the same Truth, and was 
entrusted with the same mission and duty as were all the Messengers 
preceding him. This duty and mission has been expressed in a number of 
ways: warning (indhar), bringing glad tidings (tabshir), inviting and 
calling (da'wah), communicating (tabligh), reminding (dhikr), teaching 
(ta'lim), conveying and propagating (tilawah), enjoining and promoting 
what is good and right and forbidding and eradicating what is wrong and 
bad (amr bi 'l-ma'ruf wa nahl 'ani 'l-munkar), establishing Din 
(iqamah), establishing justice (qist), making the Divine guidance and 
Din prevail (izhar), or witnessing (shahadah). All these expressions 
pertain to the same mission, though from different perspectives and with
 different
<pg>10/31</pg><pd></pd><hd>Witness Unto Mankind</hd>
 emphases. </p> 
<p>O Prophet, We have sent you as a witness [to the Truth], and as a 
herald of glad tidings and a warner, and as one who calls to God, by His
 leave, and as a light-giving lamp (al-Ahzab 33: 45-6). </p> 
<p>O Messenger, deliver that which has been sent down to you from your 
Lord; for if you do not, you will not have delivered His message 
(al-Ma'idah 5: 67). </p> 
<p>Even so We have sent among you, of yourselves, a Messenger, to convey
 unto you Our revelations, and to purify you, and to teach you the Book 
and wisdom, and to teach you that which you knew not (al-Baqarah 2: 
151). </p> 
<p>It is He who has sent forth His Messenger with the guidance and the 
way of the Truth, so that he makes it prevail over all other ways of 
life; and God suffices as a witness (al-Fath 48: 28; also 9: 33, 61: 9).
 </p> 
<p>. . . and those [among the followers of Moses] who follow the 
Messenger, the unlettered Prophet, whom they find written down with them
 in the Torah and the Gospel, who will enjoin upon them the right and 
forbid them the wrong, and make lawful to them the good things and make 
unlawful for them the bad things, and lift from them their burdens and 
the shackles that were upon them. Those who believe in him and succour 
him and help him, and follow the light that has been sent down with him 
it is they who are the prosperous (al-A'raf 7: 157). </p> 
<h4>4. Man's accountability and the witness:</h4> 
<p>The witness given by the Messengers, and by all those who are charged
 with the same duty, is the basis for man's accountability in the 
Akhirah, and his consequent reward and punishment. The Truth is 
witnessed before them so that they are left with no argument against 
God; they will be charged because they received it: this position has 
been stated in the Qur'an in many places and from many different 
perspectives, as we have seen before. </p> 
<p>Whoever follows the right path, follows it for his own good, and 
whoever goes astray, goes astray to his own loss; and no bearer of 
burdens shall bear the burden of another. We never chastise, until we 
have sent forth a Messenger (al-Isra' 17:15) </p> 
<p>So, [on Judgement Day,] We shall most certainly call to account all those unto whom
<pg>11/31</pg><pd></pd><hd>Witness Unto Mankind</hd>
 [Our] message was sent, and We shall most certainly call to account the
 Message-bearers and thereupon We shall most certainly relate unto them 
[their account] with knowledge, for We were never absent (al-A'raf 7: 
6-7). And when We took a pledge from all the Prophets from you [O 
Prophet], and from Noah, and Abraham, and Moses, and Jesus, the son of 
Mary We took from them a solemn pledge, so that He might question the 
truthful concerning their truthfulness, and He has prepared for those 
who deny the truth a painful punishment (al-Ahzab 33: 7-8). </p> 
<p>The day when God shall assemble all the Messengers, and say: What 
answer were you given? They shall say: We have no knowledge; Thou art 
the Knower of the things unseen (al-Ma'idah 5: 109). </p> 
<p>[And God will say:] O community of jinn and men, did not Messengers 
come unto you from among you, who conveyed unto you My revelations and 
warned you of the meeting of this your day? They shall say: We bear 
witness against ourselves. They were deluded by the life of this world, 
and they bear witness against themselves that they had been disbelievers
 (al-An'am 6: 130). </p> 
<p>Then the disbelievers shall be driven in companies into Jahannam 
till, when they reach it, its gates will be opened, and its keepers will
 say to them: Did not Messengers come to you, from among yourselves, who
 conveyed unto you your Lord's revelations, and warn you against the 
meeting of this your Day? They shall say: Yes, indeed! But the word of 
punishment will have fallen due upon the disbelievers; and it shall be 
said to them: Enter the gates of Jahannam, to dwell therein forever. How
 evil is the abode of those who are arrogant! (al-Zumar 39: 71-2). </p> 
<p>Surely We shall help Our Messengers and those who have believed, in 
this world's life and on the Day when all the witnesses shall stand up 
the day when their excuses shall not profit the evil-doers, and theirs 
shall be the curse, and theirs the evil abode (Ghafir 40: 1-2). </p> 
<h4>5. Sense of responsibility:</h4> 
<p>The Qur'an gives a very moving account of how God's Messengers 
devoted themselves in all earnestness to their mission, how they 
laboured hard to fulfil their duty, how they suffered heavily in their 
cause. Their history is ample testimony of this. But here two examples 
should suffice: firstly, that of the Prophet Noah and secondly, that of 
the Prophet Muhammad, blessings and peace be on them. </p>
<pg>12/31</pg><pd></pd><hm>Witness Unto Mankind</hm>
 
<p>Indeed, We sent Noah unto his people, and he dwelt among them a thousand years, all but fifty . . . (al-'Ankabut 29: 14) . </p> 
<p>He [Noah] said: My Lord, I have been calling my people night and day,
 but my call has only caused them to flee farther away. And whenever I 
called them, that Thou mightest forgive them, they put their fingers in 
their ears, and wrapped themselves in their garments, and persisted, and
 became arrogant in their pride. Then indeed I called them openly, then 
indeed I spoke publicly unto them, and I spoke unto them in private 
(Nuh. 71: 5-9). </p> 
<p>Would you [O Prophet], perhaps, torment yourself to death because they refuse to believe? (al-Shuiara' 26: 3). </p> 
<h3>3. How Should We Witness to the Truth? ]| Let us now see in what 
manner we should discharge our duty of witnessing to the Truth. 
Witnessing is of two types: one, witness by words, or the word-witness; 
the other, witness by acts and deeds, or the act-witness. [6] <p></p> 
</h3><h4>Word-witness</h4> 
<p>In what way should our words witness to the Truth? Through our speech
 and writing, we should proclaim and explain to the world the guidance 
that has come to us through God's Messengers. This, in sum, is the 
word-witness. Employing all possible methods of education, using all 
possible means of communication and propagation, mastering all knowledge
 provided by the contemporary arts and sciences, we should inform 
mankind of the way of life that God has laid down for man. The guidance 
that Islam gives to humanity in thought and belief, in morality and 
behaviour, in culture and civilization, in economics and business, in 
jurisprudence and judiciary, in politics and civil administration that 
is, in all aspects of inter-human relations we should clearly and fully 
expound before mankind. By rational discourse and convincing evidence, 
we should establish its truth and soundness. By soundly reasoned 
critique, we should rebut all that is contrary to the guidance given by 
God. </p> 
<p>The task is enormous. Full justice cannot be done to it unless the 
thought of guiding man to the right path seizes the whole Ummah as 
completely as it did each Messenger personally. It is essential, too, 
that this task should become the central objective of all our collective
 endeavours, that we should commit all our hearts and minds, all of our
<pg>13/31</pg><pd></pd><hd>Witness Unto Mankind</hd>
 resources, to this cause. Uppermost in all our actions should be this 
objective. Under no circumstances should we allow any voice within 
ourselves to bear witness against the Truth and Divine guidance that we 
have. </p> 
<h4>Act-witness</h4> 
<p>In what way should our acts and deeds witness to the Truth? For this 
purpose, the guidance that we hold to be true we must put into practice.
 Our actions should demonstrate the principles we profess to believe in.
 </p> 
<p>Put simply: let our lives speak the truth, and let the world hear it 
not merely from our lips but also from our deeds; let mankind witness 
all the blessings that the Divine guidance brings to human life. Let the
 world taste in our conduct, individual and collective, that sweetness 
and flavour which only the faith in One God can impart to character and 
morality. Let the world see what fine examples of humanity are fashioned
 by Islam, what a just society is established, what a sound social order
 emerges, what a clean and noble civilization arises, how science, 
literature, and art flourish and develop on sound lines, what a just 
economy compassionate and free from conflict is brought about. Indeed, 
how every aspect of life is set right, developed and enriched. </p> 
<p>We shall not be doing our duty to this task unless our lives, 
individual and collective, become a living embodiment of Islam: unless 
our personal characters are a living proof of its truth, our homes are 
fragrant with its teachings, our businesses and factories are 
illuminated by its rules and laws, our schools and institutions are 
shaped by its ideas and norms, and our literature and media reflect its 
principles. Indeed until our entire national policy and public life make
 its truth manifest and self-evident. </p> 
<p>In short, wherever and whenever any individual or people come in 
contact with us it is our duty to convince them, by our example, that 
the principles and teachings which Islam proclaims to be true are indeed
 true, and that they do improve the quality of human life and raise it 
to better and higher levels. </p> 
<h4>The Islamic State</h4> 
<p>Finally, I should state one more important thing. This witness of 
ours would not be complete unless we establish a state based on the 
principles and teachings of Islam. By translating its ideals and 
practices, its norms and values, its rules and laws, into public 
policies and programmes, such a state would demonstrate how the
<pg>14/31</pg><pd></pd><hd>Witness Unto Mankind</hd>
 </p> 
<p>Divine guidance leads to equity and justice, reform and upliftment, 
caring and efficient administration, social welfare, peace and order, 
high standards of morality in public servants, virtue and righteousness 
in internal policies, honesty in foreign policies, civilized conduct in 
war, integrity and loyalty in peace. Such public conduct would be a 
living testimony for all mankind that Islam is indeed the true guarantor
 of human well-being, that only following its tenets can ensure the good
 of mankind. </p> 
<p>Only when the Truth is witnessed in this manner, by both words and 
actions, will the crucial responsibility laid upon the Muslim Ummah be 
fully discharged. Only then will no ground remain for mankind to deny or
 turn away from the Divine guidance. Only then, in the Hereafter, will 
the Muslim Ummah be in a position to take the witness-stand after the 
Prophet, blessings and peace be on him, and declare that: Whatever truth
 and guidance we were given by this Prophet, that we conveyed to 
mankind; those who did not follow it are themselves to blame for going 
astray, not us. </p> 
<p>This is the real meaning and scope of the witness that we as Muslims 
ought to have been giving to the world, both by our words and our deeds.
 But now let us turn to the actual state of affairs and examine the 
witness that we in fact are giving in favour of the Divine guidance. </p> 
<h4>Notes by Khurram Murad</h4> 
<h4>6. Types of witness:</h4> 
<p>The witness by word may be taken to be broadly subsumed under the 
Quranic terminology of warning (indhar), bringing glad tidings 
(tabshir), inviting and calling (da'wah), communicating (tabligh), 
teaching and instructing (ta'lim), conveying and propagating (tilawah). 
The terminology for the witness by actions includes establishing Islam 
(iqamatu 'd-din), making God's guidance and way of life prevail over all
 others (izhar), establishing justice (qist), enjoining right and 
forbidding wrong, and Jihad. </p> 
<h3>4. Where Do we Stand? </h3> 
<h4>Our Word -Witness</h4> 
<p>First, look at the testimony that is being given by our word-witness.
 There are few people amongst us who are using their tongues and pens to
 witness to the truth of Islam. Still fewer in number are those who are 
doing so in an appropriate and adequate
<pg>15/31</pg><pd></pd><hd>Witness Unto Mankind</hd>
 manner. Otherwise, in almost every respect Muslims, on the whole, are 
giving their witness against Islam and not in its favour as they should.
 What is the witness of our landlords? That the Islamic law of 
inheritance is wrong and that the customs which came down from the 
pre-Islamic days are correct. What is the witness of our lawyers and 
judges? That all the laws of Islam are bad laws, and that their very 
basis the sovereignty of God is unacceptable. They tell us that only the
 man-made laws, which have come to us through the British, are good 
laws. </p> 
<p>What is the witness of our teachers and educational institutions? 
That in philosophy and science, history and sociology, economics and 
politics, law and ethics, the only true and valid knowledge and thought 
is that derived from the Western secular world-view. That in all these 
disciplines the Islamic approach is not even worthy of consideration. 
What is the witness of our writers? That their literature has the same 
message to impart as that of the godless writers of the secular West. 
They demonstrate that as Muslims they have no distinctive literary 
approach of their own. What is the witness of our press and media? That 
the only issues and debates that they consider important and which 
preoccupy them, and the only methods and standards of communication that
 they consider fit to employ, are those which bear the hallmark of the 
non-Muslim media. </p> 
<p>What is the witness of our businessmen and industrialists? That the 
rules laid down by Islam for economic transactions are impracticable, 
that business can be conducted only by the methods devised by Kafirs.* 
What is the witness of our leaders and rulers? That they have the same 
slogans of nationalism and motherland to mobilize people, the same goals
 to pursue on national levels, the same methods of solving national 
problems, the same principles of politics and constitution-makingv as 
are practised by Kafirs. They declare that Islam has no guidance to 
offer in this respect. </p> 
<p>And what is the witness of our masses? They testify that they have 
nothing to speak about except worldly matters, that they have no such 
Din which desires to be propagated or which demands that they spend part
 of their time for this purpose. This, then, is the state of witness 
being given by our whole Ummah by means of its words. This is the case 
not only in this country but throughout the whole world. </p> 
<h4>Our Act -Witness</h4> 
<p>Now let us turn to our act-witness and look at the witness being 
given by our actions and deeds. Here our conduct is even more scandalous
 than that in respect of our witness by words. No doubt there are a few 
good Muslims whose lives are a true example of Islam.
<pg>16/31</pg><pd></pd><hd>Witness Unto Mankind</hd>
 But consider how the overwhelming majority of the Ummah, the society at large, is conducting itself. </p> 
<p>What is the witness being given by the life of a typical, ordinary 
Muslim? That the persons shaped and moulded by Islam are in no way 
better than, or different from, those prepared by Kufr. If anything, the
 former are worse than the latter: for instance, it is more likely that a
 Muslim would speak a lie, that he would betray and breach a trust 
placed in him, that he would oppress people and do wrong to them, that 
he would abandon his promise, that he would steal and rob, that he would
 engage himself in disorderly and violent conduct, that he would indulge
 in all sorts of indecent acts. Indeed, in respect of all these immoral 
actions the level of Muslim 'performance' is no less than that of any 
Kafir people. </p> 
<p>What is the witness of our social life? Look at our life-styles, our 
customs and ceremonies, our festivities, our fairs and religious 
gatherings, our meetings and processions: in no aspect do we truly 
represent Islam. Indeed, on the contrary, our social life is a pathetic 
testimony that the followers of Islam consider the un-Islamic ways to be
 better and preferable than the Islamic. </p> 
<p>Similar is the testimony of our other social institutions and 
collective pursuits. When we set up educational institutions, we import 
everything from Kafirs our knowledge, our educational system, our 
philosophy, our spirit and objective. When we form parties and 
associations, we model everything on the patterns set by Kafirs our 
ideals and goals, our structures and constitutions, our policies and 
methods. When we, as a people, launch a struggle, our cause, our slogans
 and demands, our issues and debates, our programmes and procedures, our
 resolutions, statements, and speeches, are all true replicas of the 
practices of Kafir communities and nations. </p> 
<p>Things have come to such a pass that even our independent states, 
where they exist, have borrowed their constitutions, their codes of law,
 and their guiding policies and principles from Kafirs. In some states, 
the Islamic law has been reduced to a mere personal law; in some others 
even this personal law has been altered. An English writer tauntingly 
remarks: </p> 
<p>In view of the many charges levelled by Indians at the British 
administration, it is important to realize that the British were 
extraordinarily slow to introduce any innovations in the law . . . 
[Indeed] as far as Islam is concerned the result of the British
<pg>17/31</pg><pd></pd><hd>Witness Unto Mankind</hd>
 connexion with India has been to establish on a firmer basis the Muslim
 personal and religious law . . . while all the rest of the shari'a has 
been abolished . . . </p> 
<p>On the other hand Albania and Turkey have both become secular states 
[adopting European penal and civil codes, even altering Muslim penal 
law] . . . [Thus, it can be said, as Lindsay says, that] 'The Muslim 
doctrine that legislation is not within the competence of an earthly 
sovereign was never, indeed, anything more than a pious fiction . . .' </p> 
<p>This, then, is the witness being given by the actions of almost all 
Muslims. This witness, too, goes against Islam. It is not in its favour.
 Whatever lip-service we might pay to Islam, our public conduct proves 
that there is no aspect of Islam that we approve of, that we do not 
consider its laws to be good and conducive to our well-being. </p> 
<h3>5. And With What Consequences! </h3> 
<h4>Our Punishment</h4> 
<p>In view of our conduct, we are guilty of giving false witness, of 
perjury and concealing the Truth. As a consequence, we are facing 
precisely the same punishment that has been prescribed in the Law of God
 for such grave and heinous crimes. </p> 
<p>What is this law? When a people reject and turn away from God's 
guidance, when they are guilty of perjury and disloyalty to their 
Creator, and when they turn traitors to Him, then God punishes them 
severely in this world as well as in the world-to-come. [7] This law was
 applied to the Children of Israel. [8] Now it is we, the Muslim Ummah, 
who stand in the dock. God had no personal vendetta against the Jews 
that He should have punished only them. Nor does He have any kinship or 
special relationship with Muslims that He should set us free even though
 we are now committing the same crime as they did then. [9] </p> 
<h4>In This World</h4> 
<p>The punishment meted out to Muslims for their crimes in this world is
 there for all to see. Indeed, the extent and pace of our decline has 
been in true proportion to the extent and pace of our negligence and 
failure to do our duty to witness to the Truth and our 'progress' in 
witnessing to falsehood. During the last one hundred years, from Morocco
 to Indonesia, country after country has been lost by us to alien 
subjugation; one Muslim people after another have fallen under the yoke 
of colonial rule and domination. No
<pg>18/31</pg><pd></pd><hd>Witness Unto Mankind</hd>
 longer does the word 'Muslim' stand for dignity, no longer does it 
command respect; rather it has become a mark of degradation, 
humiliation, gross backwardness, and utter powerlessness. </p> 
<p>How powerless have we become? We have lost all honour and respect in 
the eyes of the world. In some places, our blood has flowed like water 
and we have been subjected to large-scale massacres; in other places, we
 have been driven out of our homes; in others, we have been tortured and
 persecuted; in still others, we have been reduced to living as serfs. 
If in some places Muslim states have survived, they have suffered defeat
 after defeat until they have been reduced to positions of fear and 
impotency in the face of foreign powers. If only they had witnessed to 
Islam by their words and deeds, the secular powers would have stood in 
awe of them. </p> 
<p>Why go so far afield? Just look at your situation in India. + Because
 you evaded your duty of bearing witness to the truth of Islam, indeed 
because you went further and gave false witness against it both by your 
words and deeds, the entire country was wrested from your control. 
First, you were vanquished by the Marathas and Sikhs, and later, 
servitude to the British rule became your fate. And now still greater 
calamities stare you in the face. </p> 
<p>Today your minority status has become your greatest anxiety; you live
 in fear of the Hindu majority lest it subjugates you and you meet the 
same fate as did the untouchables. But, for God's sake, tell me: Could a
 majority have threatened you if you had only been true witnesses of 
Islam? Will not this problem of majority and minority vanish within a 
few years if today your words and actions bear true witnesses to Islam? </p> 
<p>In Arabia, an extremely hostile and oppressive majority set out to 
exterminate an insignificant minority of about one in one hundred 
thousand. With what result? Within ten years, this minority, by its 
truthful and trustworthy witness in favour of Islam, turned into a one 
hundred per cent majority. Later, when these witnesses of Islam emerged 
from Arabia, within twenty-five years, from Turkistan to Morocco, people
 after people trusted the probity of their witness and joined them in 
their faith. Where no one but Zoroastrians, Christians and pagans once 
lived, now only Muslims live. No intransigence, no chauvinism, no 
religious bigotry, proved strong enough to resist the living, true 
witness of the Divine guidance that Muslims gave. </p> 
<p>If you are being trampled upon today, if you fear greater 
catastrophes tomorrow, is this not but the punishment for your false 
witness and concealment of the Truth?</p>
<pg>19/31</pg><pd></pd><hm>Witness Unto Mankind</hm>
 
<h4>Punishment in the World-to-Come</h4> 
<p>This is the punishment you are receiving in this world; but a more 
severe punishment is likely to be meted out to you in the world-tocome. 
How can you be absolved of the blame for every evil and every wrong to 
which man has been subjected only because you failed to do your duty as 
witnesses of the Truth? Unless you do your duty, whatever oppression and
 corruption is perpetrated in the world and whatever immorality and 
wickedness prevails, there is no reason why you should not be held 
accountable for it. You may not be responsible for originating them 
yourselves, but you are certainly responsible, because of your false 
witness, for maintaining and perpetuating them, for their origination by
 others, and for allowing them to spread. </p> 
<h4>Notes by Khurram Murad</h4> 
<h4>7. Consequences of failure and neglect:</h4> 
<p>The mission to witness the Truth and invite mankind to surrender to 
its Creator has the status of a covenant with God. Those who give up 
this mission, or fail to fulfil it or neglect it, are guilty of 
breaching their covenant. Hence they are cursed by God, and deprived of 
His blessings. They are cursed by angels, too, because the light brought
 by them has been extinguished by such people while mankind gropes in 
darkness; and by mankind as well, for its sufferings and miseries are 
due mainly to the conduct of those who were entrusted with that light. </p> 
<p>Those who conceal the clear messages and the guidance that We have 
sent down, after We have made them clear, for mankind, in the Book they 
shall be cursed by God and the cursers; but such as repent and put 
themselves right, and make [the Book] known towards them I shall turn, I
 am the Accepter of repentance, the Mercy-giving. But those who remain 
[in the state of] denial and die denying upon them shall be the curse of
 God, and the angels, and of all mankind . . . (al-Baqarah 2: 159-61). </p> 
<p>And, humiliation and powerlessness afflicted them, and they earned 
God's anger; all this, because they persisted in denying God's messages 
and in slaying the Prophets against all right; all this, because they 
rebelled [against God], and persisted in transgressing [the bounds of 
God] (al-Baqarah 2: 61). </p> 
<p>The duty, obviously, is neglected or given up for the sake of worldly gains. These gains
<pg>20/31</pg><pd></pd><hd>Witness Unto Mankind</hd>
 the Qur'an describes as a trifle, which earn God's anger for the 
defaulters. The punishment for this crime which the Qur'an mentions, is 
indeed the only one of its kind, for such punishment is not mentioned 
for any other crime. </p> 
<p>Indeed, those who conceal what God has sent down in the Book, and 
barter it away for a trifle price they eat nothing but fire in their 
bellies. And God shall not speak unto them on the Day of Resurrection, 
nor purify them; and for them is painful punishment. It is they who have
 bought error at the price of guidance, and punishment at the price of 
forgiveness. How patiently have they accepted the Fire! All that, 
because God has sent down the Book with the Truth, those who differ in 
the matter of the Book are most deeply in the wrong (al-Baqarah 2: 
174-6; also 3: 77-8). </p> 
<h4>8. The Jewish example:</h4> 
<p>The history of the people of Israel is narrated by the Qur'an in 
considerable detail. It provides the most instructive example of a 
people who were guided by some of the greatest Messengers of God. They 
made a covenant with God that they will be only His servants and obey 
only Him and be His witnesses. They rose to great heights and 
contributed much to the good of mankind by fulfilling their covenant. 
But, finally, they broke their covenant, suffered grievously, and thus 
became an object lesson in how people chosen by God to be witnesses to 
His guidance may go astray and how they may earn God's anger. </p> 
<p>The purpose of narrating their history is neither to create hatred 
against any particular religion and people nor to take pleasure and 
comfort in their suffering and humiliation. This becomes evident from 
the fact that, despite very severe strictures against the people of 
Israel by the Qur'an, the most peaceful and glorious days of Jewish 
history, in the last two thousand years, have been lived under Islamic 
rule. In fact their history is meant to act like a mirror which the 
Qur'an holds to the Muslims so that they may recognize themselves when 
they go astray and may remain aware of the painful consequences of such 
conduct. Another purpose, of course, was to awaken the Jews at the time 
of the Prophet, blessings and peace be on him, and to invite them to 
believe in the Last Prophet and support him, as their own mission 
demanded. The Quranic account is similar to the Biblical account; if 
anything, much milder in tone and language. </p> 
<p>Firstly, the Qur'an shows that great blessings were conferred by God 
on the people of Israel, the greatest of them being the Book and 
guidance from Him, and that they were chosen to be His special servants.
<pg>21/31</pg><pd></pd><hd>Witness Unto Mankind</hd>
 </p> 
<p>Children of Israel, remember My blessing with which I blessed you, 
and how I favoured you above all other people (al-Baqarah 2: 47). </p> 
<p>And when Moses said unto his people: O my people, remember God's 
blessing upon you, when He appointed among you Prophets, and made you 
kings, and gave you such as He had not given to any beings (al-Ma'idah 
5: 20). </p> 
<p>And when We made a covenant with the Children of Israel: You shall 
serve and worship none but God; and to be good to parents, and the near 
kinsman, and to the orphan, and to the needy; and speak good to man, and
 perform the prayer, and give the alms (al- Baqarah 2: 83). </p> 
<p>And when We made covenant with you [O Children of Israel], and raised
 above you the Mount: hold fast with [all your] strength unto what We 
have given you, and remember what is in it, so that you might remain 
conscious of God. Then you turned away after that . . . (al-Baqarah 2: 
63-4). Surely We sent down the Torah, wherein was guidance and light; 
thereby the Prophets, who had surrendered themselves [to God], gave 
judgement for those who were Jews; and so did the men of God and the 
rabbis, following such portion of God's Book as they were given to keep;
 and they bore witness to its truth (al-Ma'idah 5: 44). </p> 
<p>The Bible gives a similar account: </p> 
<p>Do this because you belong to the Lord your God. From all the peoples
 on earth, He chose you to be His own special people. The Lord did not 
love you and choose you because you outnumbered other peoples; you were 
the smallest nation on earth (Deut. 7: 67). </p> 
<p> At Mount Sinai the Lord our God made a covenant, not only with our 
fathers, but with all of us who are living today. There on the mountain 
the Lord spoke to you face-to-face from the Fire . . . The Lord said, 'I
 am the Lord your God, who rescued you from Egypt, where you were 
slaves. Worship no god but Me' (Deut. 5: 2-7). </p> 
<p>Israel, remember this! The Lord and the Lord alone is our God. Love 
the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all 
your strength. Never forget these commands that I am giving you today. 
Teach them to your children. Repeat them when you are at home and when 
you are away, when you are resting and when you are working. Tie them on
 your arms and wear them on your foreheads as a reminder. Write
<pg>22/31</pg><pd></pd><hd>Witness Unto Mankind</hd>
 them on the door-posts of your houses and on your gates (Deut. 6: 4-9).
 [This is a very good exegesis of the Quranic words 'and remember'.] </p> 
<p>Never forget the Lord your God or turn to other gods to worship and 
serve them. If you do, then I warn you today that you will certainly be 
destroyed (Deut. 8: 19). </p> 
<p>People of Israel, you are My witnesses; I chose you to be My servant,
 so that you would know Me and believe in Me and understand that I am 
the only God. Beside Me there is no other god; there never was and never
 will be (Isa. 43: 10). </p> 
<p>Secondly, the Qur'an exhorts and invites the people of Israel, as 
does the Bible, to fulfil their covenant with God, to believe in His 
last message, and to bear witness to its truth, reminding them of the 
promise and threat that were made to them. Children of Israel, remember 
My blessing with which I blessed you, and fulfil My covenant [with you],
 and I shall fulfil your covenant [with Me]; and of Me alone stand in 
awe! (al-Baqarah 2: 40). </p> 
<p>Remember that the Lord your God is the only God and that He is 
faithful. He will keep His covenant and show His constant love to a 
thousand generations of those who love Him and obey His commands, but He
 will not hesitate to punish those who hate Him (Deut. 7: 9-10). </p> 
<p>If you obey the Lord your God and do everything He commands, He will 
make you His own people, as He has promised . . . The Lord your God will
 make you the leader among the nations and not a follower; you will 
always prosper and never fail . . . But if you disobey the Lord your God
 and do not faithfully keep all His commandments and laws that I am 
giving you today, all these evil things will happen to you . . . the 
Lord will curse everything you do . . . (Deut. 28: 9-19). </p> 
<p>I will be your God, and you will be My people (Lev. 26: 12) . </p> 
<p>Thirdly, the Qur'an indicts the people of Israel for breaking their 
covenant and neglecting their duty to worship and obey only God and to 
be His witnesses. Not only did they themselves turn away from the 
message of their Lord, they also prevented others from accepting and 
following it. </p> 
<p>People of the Book, why do you disbelieve God's revelations while you
 yourselves witness [their truth]? People of the Book, why do you cloak 
the truth with falsehood and conceal the truth, and that knowingly (Al 
'Imran 3: 70-1).
<pg>23/31</pg><pd></pd><hd>Witness Unto Mankind</hd>
 </p> 
<p>Say: People of the book, why do you bar from the path of God those 
who believe, trying to make it appear crooked, you yourselves being 
witnesses to its truth? (Al 'Imran 3: 99) . </p> 
<p>Indeed, God made covenant with the Children of Israel, when We raised
 from among them twelve of their leaders, and God said: I am with you. 
Surely, if you perform the prayer, and pay the alms, and believe in My 
Messengers, and succour them and lend to God a good loan, I will surely 
efface your evil deeds and I will admit you to gardens through which 
running waters flow. But whosoever of you thereafter disbelieves, surely
 he has gone astray from the right way. Then, for their breaking their 
covenant We cursed them and made their hearts hard . . . (al-Ma'idah 5: 
12-13). </p> 
<p>Indeed, We made covenant with the Children of Israel, and We sent 
Messengers to them; whenever there came to them a Messenger with what 
they did not like [they rebelled], to some they gave the lie, while 
others they slayed (al-Ma'idah 5: 70). </p> 
<p>The People of the Book will ask you to bring down upon them a Book 
from heaven; and they asked Moses for greater than that, for they said: 
Make us see God face to face whereupon the thunderbolt overtook them for
 their evil doing. Then, they took to [worshipping] the calf and this 
after the clear Truth had come to them; yet We pardoned them that, and 
We bestowed upon Moses a clear authority [for the Truth]. And We raised 
above them the Mount making covenant with them; and We said to them: 
Enter the gate, prostrating; and We said to them: Transgress not the 
Sabbath; and We made a solemn covenant with them. So [We cursed them] 
for their breaking the covenant, and their denying the revelations of 
God, and their slaying the Prophets without right, and for their saying,
 'Our hearts are closed [to false guidance]' nay, but God sealed them 
for their disbelief so they believe not, except a few and for their 
disbelief and their uttering against Mary an awesome calumny, and for 
their saying, 'We killed the Messiah, Jesus, son of Mary, the Messenger 
of God' (al-Nisa' 4: 153-7). </p> 
<p>Cursed were the disbelievers among the Children of Israel by the 
tongue of David, and Jesus, the son of Mary; this, because they rebelled
 [against God] and persisted in transgression. They did not prevent one 
another from the wrongs they committed. Surely evil were the things they
 did (al-Ma'idah 5: 78-9). </p> 
<p>The Bible speaks in the same vein. Its indictment is no different 
from that which the Qur'an says, although it is said more harshly and 
with severer strictures.
<pg>24/31</pg><pd></pd><hd>Witness Unto Mankind</hd>
 </p> 
<p>In addition, the leaders of Judah, the priests, and the people 
followed the sinful example of the nations round them in worshipping 
idols, and so they defiled the Temple, which the Lord Himself had made 
holy. The Lord, the God of their ancestors, had continued to send 
prophets to warn His people, because He wanted to spare them and the 
Temple. But they ridiculed God's Messengers, ignoring His words and 
laughing at His prophets, until at last the Lord's anger against His 
people was so great that there was no escape (2 Chr. 36: 14-16). </p> 
<p>God told me to write down in a Book what the people are like, so that
 there would be a permanent record of how evil they are. They are always
 rebelling against God, always Iying, always refusing to listen to the 
Lord's teachings. They tell the prophets to keep quiet. They say: 'Don't
 talk to us about what's right. Tell us what we want to hear. Let us 
keep our illusions. Get out of our way and stop blocking our path. We 
don't want to hear about your holy God of Israel' (Isa. 30: 8-11). </p> 
<p>But Your people rebelled and disobeyed You; they turned their backs 
on Your law. They killed the prophets who warned them, who told them to 
turn back to You. They insulted You time after time, so You let their 
enemies conquer and rule them (Neh. 9: 26-7). </p> 
<p>The Children I brought up have rebelled against Me. Cattle know who 
owns them, and donkeys know where their master feeds them. But that is 
more than my people Israel know. They don't understand at all . . . The 
city that once was faithful is behaving like a whore! At one time it was
 filled with righteous men, but now only murderers remain. Jerusalem, 
you were once like silver, but now you are worthless; . . . Your leaders
 are rebels and friends of thieves; they are always accepting gifts and 
bribes. They never defend orphans in court or listen when widows present
 their case (Isa. 1: 2-23). </p> 
<p>And this is how Jesus censures the people of Israel. Jerusalem, 
Jerusalem! You kill the prophets and stone the Messengers God has sent 
you! . . . And so your temple will be abandoned and empty (Mt. 23: 
37-8). </p> 
<p>They tie on to people's backs loads that are heavy and are hard to 
carry, yet they aren't willing even to lift a finger to help them carry 
those loads. They do everything so that people will see them. Look at 
the straps with Scripture verses on them which they wear on their 
foreheads and arms, and notice how large they are! Notice also how long 
are the tassels on their cloaks! They love the best places at feasts and
 the reserved seats in the synagogues; they love to be greeted with 
respect in the market places and to be called
<pg>25/31</pg><pd></pd><hd>Witness Unto Mankind</hd>
 'Teacher' . . . You hypocrites! You lock the door to the Kingdom of 
heaven in people's faces, and you yourselves don't go in, nor do you 
allow in those who are trying to enter! . . . You clean the outside of 
your cup and plate, while the inside is full of what you have obtained 
by violence and selfishness . . . You are like whitewashed tombs, which 
look fine on the outside but are full of bones and decaying corpses on 
the inside . . . So you actually admit that you are the descendants of 
those who murdered the prophets! Go on, then, and finish what your 
ancestors started! You snakes and sons of snakes! How do you expect to 
escape from being condemned to hell? And so I tell you that I will send 
you prophets and wise men and teachers; you will kill some of them, 
crucify others, and whip others in the synagogues and chase them from 
town to town (Mt. 23: 4-34). </p> 
<p>Perhaps the most moving account of the fate of Israel is in the 
lamentations of the Prophet Isaiah, peace be upon him. Describing Israel
 as a vineyard planted by God, he first describes how He blessed it with
 every bounty, then goes on to describe how it produced sour fruits, and
 how God punished it something very similar to what Sayyid Mawdudi has 
said about the Muslims. </p> 
<p>My friend had a vineyard on a very fertile hill. He dug the soil and 
cleared it of stones; he planted the finest vines. He built a tower to 
guard them, dug a pit for treading the grapes. He waited for the grapes 
to ripen, but every grape was sour. </p> 
<p>So now my friend says: 'You people who live in Jerusalem and Judah, 
judge, between my vineyard and me. Is there anything I failed to do for 
it? Then why did it produce sour grapes and not the good grapes I 
expected? </p> 
<p>This is what I am going to do to my vineyard; I will take away the 
hedge round it, break down the wall that protects it, and let wild 
animals eat it and trample it down. I will let it be overgrown with 
weeds. I will not prune the vines or hoe the ground; instead I will let 
briers and thorns cover it. I will even forbid the clouds to let rain 
fall upon it (Isa. 5: 14). </p> 
<p>Finally, the Qur'an also makes it clear that, after Israel, it is the
 Muslims who have been appointed to fulfil the same mission as was 
granted to Israel. </p> 
<p>Indeed, We gave the Children of Israel the Book, the Judgement, and 
the Prophethood; and We provided them with good things, and We favoured 
them above all other people. And We gave them clear revelations 
pertaining to the affair [of their Din]; so they did not take to 
different ways after the knowledge had come to themexcept for the sake 
of mutual transgression . . . then We set you [O Muhammad] on the Way 
[Shari'ah]
<pg>26/31</pg><pd></pd><hd>Witness Unto Mankind</hd>
 pertaining to the affair [of your Din]; therefore follow it, and follow
 not the likes ahd dislikes of those who do not know (al-Jathiyah 45: 
1S18) . </p> 
<h4>9. Illusions and excuses:</h4> 
<p>When a faith as total, pervasive, deep and dynamic as Islam living in
 surrender to the One God which is a calling and a commitrnent, becomes 
transformed into a religion, hereditary and sectarian, its followers 
invent certain popular beliefs to calm and quieten their conscience. On 
the basis of such illusions and excuses, they are able to live 
peacefully while failing in their total commitment to God. They neglect 
the mission that He has entrusted to them, as well as refuse to accept 
any summons to renew their faith and take up their duty. The Qur'an 
mentions some such popular notions which had become part of the Jewish 
faith, and categorically rejects them. Again, the objective is neither 
to condemn a certain faith and people for all times to come nor to 
nurture hatred against them, but to induce them to correct their wrong 
beliefs, and more importantly, to warn the Muslims to beware of such 
notions. It is ironic that one would find all such popular beliefs to be
 part of the Muslims' faith as well today; for example, that our Ummah 
is the beloved of God, that Muslims, whatever the state of their belief 
and conduct, have a monopoly over Paradise, that God's mercies and 
rewards are reserved exclusively for them, that, even if they are 
punished, their punishment will last only a few days </p> 
<p>And the Jews and Christians say: We are God's children, and His 
beloved ones. Say: Why then does He punish you for your sins? Nay, you 
are but human beings of His creating. He forgives whom He wills, and He 
punishes whom He wills (al-Ma'idah 5: 18). </p> 
<p>And that they say: None shall enter Paradise unless he be a Jew or a 
Christian. Such are their wishful beliefs! Say: Produce your proof, if 
what you say is true! Nay, whosoever surrenders his whole being unto 
God, attaining to excellence, his reward shall be with his Lord, and no 
fear shall be on them, neither shall they sorrow (al-Baqarah 2: 111-12).
 </p> 
<p>And they say: The Fire shall not touch us save a number of days. Say:
 Have you made with God a covenant then God will not fail in His 
covenant or you attribute to God some thing of which you know nothing? 
Not so; whoso earns evil, and is engulfed by his transgressions those 
are the inhabitants of the Fire . . . (al-Baqarah 2: 81). </p> 
<p>And when they are told: Believe in what God has sent down, they say: We believe in
<pg>27/31</pg><pd></pd><hd>Witness Unto Mankind</hd>
 what was sent down on us; and they disbelieve what is beyond that, yet 
it is the truth confirming what is with them. Say: Why then did you kill
 God's Prophets in former times, if you were believers? (al-Baqarah 2: 
91). </p> 
<p>Say: If the abode in the life-to-come is to be for you alone, to the 
exclusion of all other people, then long for that if what you say is 
true! But never will they long for it, because of what their hands have 
sent ahead; God knows the evil-doers; . . . (al-Baqarah 2: 95). </p> 
<h3>6. What is Our Real Problem? </h3> 
<h4>Pseudo Problems</h4> 
<p>By now, brothers, you must have understood how we, as Muslims, ought 
to have been living and behaving, and how we in fact are living and 
behaving. You must also have realized what grave consequences we are 
suffering because of our conduct. You should, therefore, have no 
difficulty in seeing that the problems which Muslims consider crucial 
for their societies and which they are doing their utmost to solve by 
various devices some of them invented by them, but mostly copied from 
others are not their real problem. The time, energy and resources that 
they spend on solving these problems are simply being wasted. </p> 
<p>For example, we look upon ourselves as a minority engulfed by an 
overwhelming alien majority, or as a majority deprived of its 
sovereignty within its own territory, or as a nation subjugated and 
exploited by a foreign power, or as a people suffering from backwardness
 and poverty. Then we devote all our efforts to achieving objectives 
which emanate from these conceptions and images of ourselves. For 
instance, to objectives such as safeguarding and securing our status in a
 country as a minority, or to achieving sovereignty within our 
territorial boundaries, or to winning freedom from foreign domination, 
or to achieving the same levels of economic progress and development as 
those of the advanced nations. </p> 
<p>These and other similar issues may be the foremost concerns of those 
who are not Muslims, who do not accept God as their Lord and Guide, and 
may form the central objects of their endeavours. But for us Muslims 
they are not the primary problems; we face them only because we have 
been, and still are, neglecting to do our duty. Had we been true 
witnesses of Islam, we would not have found ourselves lost in such a 
dense jungle of complex and inextricable problems. If we now direct all 
our attention and endeavours to doing our duty instead of dissipating 
our energies on clearing the woods,
<pg>28/31</pg><pd></pd><hd>Witness Unto Mankind</hd>
 they will clear in no time, and not only for ourselves but for all 
mankind. For, keeping the world clean and improving it is our 
responsibility; as we have forsaken our appointed duty, the world has 
become infested with thorny woods. And no wonder that the most thorny 
part has fallen to our lot. </p> 
<p>Unfortunately, our religious and political leaders do not try to 
understand this simple but crucial reality. Everywhere they continue to 
convince the Muslims that their problems are the problems of a minority 
as against a majority, of material progress, of national security, of 
winning freedom and independence as a nation state. Furthermore, even 
the solutions that they recommend have been borrowed from non-Muslims. 
But just as I believe in God, so I believe that you are being misled, 
and that by following such paths you will never achieve your well-being 
and destiny. </p> 
<h4>Our Real Problem</h4> 
<p>What, then, is our real problem? If I do not tell you that clearly, 
without any reservation, I shall be doing you a great disservice. To my 
mind, your destiny, now and ever, depends on one issue only: How do you 
conduct yourselves in respect of God's guidance that has come to you 
through His Messenger, blessings and peace be on him? </p> 
<p>Because of this guidance you are Muslims. Because of this guidance, 
whether you like it or not, you have agreed to become ambassadors of 
Islam to the entire world. Therefore, only if you follow Islam totally 
and devotedly, if your words and actions bear true witness to its 
teachings, if your social and public conduct faithfully represents every
 aspect of Islam, will you rise from glory to glory in this world, and 
receive highest honours in the world-to-come. Then, in no time, the dark
 clouds of fear and anxiety, of disgrace and humiliation, of subjugation
 and slavery will disperse. Then, the truth of your message and the 
virtue of your character will capture mind after mind and heart after 
heart. Then, your prestige and reputation, your influence and authority,
 will hold sway over the world. Hopes of securing justice will be pinned
 on you, trust will be placed in your integrity and honesty, prospects 
of virtue will be confided in you, and authority will be accorded to 
your world. </p> 
<p>In contrast, the leaders of secularism will lose all credibility and 
authority. Their philosophy and world-view, their economic and political
 ideologies, will prove fake and spurious when confronted by your truth 
and right conduct. The forces that today belong to the secular camp 
will, one by one, break away and join the camp of Islam. A time will, 
then, come when communism will live in fear of its very survival in 
Moscow itself, when
<pg>29/31</pg><pd></pd><hd>Witness Unto Mankind</hd>
 capitalist democracy will shudder at the thought of defending itself 
even in Washington and New York, when materialist secularism will be 
unable to find a place even in the universities of London and Paris, 
when racialism and nationalism will not win even one devotee even among 
the Brahmans and Germans. </p> 
<p>The present era of abject humiliation will, then, become consigned to
 the pages of history. It will only serve to remind us of the days when 
the followers of a faith as universal and powerful as Islam were reduced
 to such stupidity that they trembled in the face of sticks and ropes 
while they held the staff of Moses under their arm. </p> 
<p>This future is yours! But only if you follow Islam sincerely and 
exclusively and serve as its faithful witnesses. Your present conduct, 
however, is entirely contrary. You have been blessed with the Divine 
guidance, but, like a snake guarding treasure, you neither benefit from 
it yourselves nor allow others to benefit from it. By calling yourselves
 Muslims, you have assumed for yourselves the position of Islam's 
representatives, but the combined witness of your words and deeds is 
being given mostly in favour of Ignorance (Jahillyah), idolatry, 
materialism, and immorality. You have the Book of God with you, but you 
have put it on the shelf and, to seek guidance, you turn to all sorts of
 persons who lead to Kufr, and to sources which lead you astray. You 
claim to be the servants of the One God, but in fact you are serving 
every false god, every Satan, and every power in rebellion against God. 
You have friends and enemies, but it is always your personal, selfish 
interests that determine your friendship and enmity. In both cases you 
use Islam as a party to your cause. </p> 
<p>Thus, your conduct has, on the one hand, deprived your lives of the 
blessings that Islam has to offer you, and, on the other, you are 
alienating mankind rather than attracting it to Islam. If you continue 
to behave in this manner, you can attain no good, either in this world 
or in the world-to-come. Its outcome, according to the Law of God, is 
that miserable situation in which you find yourselves. What the future 
holds for you may be much worse. </p> 
<p>To be truthful, perhaps, if you remove the label of Islam from 
yourselves and follow Kufr openly and sincerely, then you might at least
 make as much worldly progress as America, Russia and Britain have made.
 But, claiming to be Muslims and yet behaving as non- Muslims, closing 
the door of Divine guidance to mankind by representing Islam falsely 
before it, is such a heinous crime that it will never allow you to 
prosper in this world. There is no way you can avert the punishment 
prescribed by the Qur'an for this
<pg>30/31</pg><pd></pd><hd>Witness Unto Mankind</hd>
 crime. Jewish history provides a living proof of this reality. You may 
turn to secular nationalism as a lesser evil, you may get yourself 
accepted as a separate nation and achieve whatever Muslim nationalism 
seeks to achieve. But none of this will help you. </p> 
<p>There is only one way to ward off the punishment of God. Turn back from your sin, and repent. </p>
